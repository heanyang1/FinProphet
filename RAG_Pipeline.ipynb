Moshe Sokol, Dean of the Lander College for Men, nominated me to the T ouro Academy of Leadership and Management. TCALM, as it became known, is an advisory group to our institution’ s Provost and President concerning institution-wide strategic initiatives. Thank you Dr . Sokol for your support in this and so many other enterprises. Y ou are my mentor , col- league, and friend. As a member of TCALM, I was privileged to sit through fascinating monthly seminars on multiple subjects deliv- ered by compelling and diverse speakers on a range of top- ics. In the end, my team, consisting of Dr . Barbara Capozzi, and Dr . Jennifer Zelnick, created the T ouro Interdiscipli- nary Institute for Healthy Aging (TIIHA). I wish to thank TCALM management, and especially Drs. Laurie Bobley , Sabra Brock, and Alan Sebel for the fine work they did in designing and implementing the program. In the Fall of 2019, T ouro’ s president, Dr . Alan Kadish ceremoniously awarded me and my new colleagues, Certificates of Com- pletion. It was a privilege and an honor . In the course of my membership in TCALM, I met Sara Tabaei, a fellow member and T ouro Library’ s Information Literacy Director , who introduced me to Open T ouro, an open educational resources (OER) project that she initiated in 2018. This led to my being introduced to Mr . Kirk Sny- der, Touro’ s OER and Instruction Librarian, who coordi- nated the peer review process for this book, painstakinglyIntroduction toFinancial Analysis xix xix\\n\\nedited my words, and formatted the raw document into the highly readable and aesthetic work you will see on the pages to follow . Mr. Snyder ’s endless patience, dili- gence, and unfailing attention to details are admired with gratitude. This work would never have seen the light of day without you, Kirk. Ms. Jacquelyn Albanese, a student library assistant, complemented Kirk with invaluable pro- duction assistance. This work started out as class notes and gradually devel- oped into the product before you. The questions and thoughts of my students are embedded in these pages. I learned new perspectives to the material from students. These questions often resulted in my penning wholly addi- tional pages concerning issues that had not occurred to me and which demanded development. I wrote this book for you. Thanks, guys! I wish to express my appreciation to T ouro’ s Dean of Fac- ulties, Dr . Stanley Boylan who, over the years, has sup- ported my academic work and with whom I can say that I have developed a warm personal and productive profes- sional relationship. Last, I owe may greatest gratitude to my wife and three amazing children. When I joined T ouro University’ s Queens campus (the Lander College for Men), the school had just opened and had few students. The demands on my time were challenging. My then two children were under the age of three and needed paternal attention. I would come home late at night after having completed my classes and they would already be asleep. My now three children know little about my long life before I joined T ouro; they know me only as a T ouro professor . They for gave me for not being there to do homework with them (I did manage toxx Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nsqueeze in some) and for not tucking them in at night. They came out alright, thanks to the wonderful love and unceas- ing care of their mother , my dear wife, Mira. And it is to her that I owe the deepest and never -ending gratitude. Mira, you personify the notion of Eshet Chayil , and are my personal W oman of V alor. To say more would merely be understatement and misspent words ( haval al hazeman ). I love you forever and always. I am humbled and grateful to each and every one men- tioned on these pages, and it is to you that these pages are dedicated. Introduction toFinancial Analysis xxi\\n\\nOpen T ouro Acknowledgements Open T ouro was founded by T ouro College Libraries in 2018, as the Open Educational Resources initiative of Touro College & University System (now T ouro Univer- sity). Open T ouro aims to reduce the cost of textbooks for students by promoting innovative and equitable open education practices. Open T ouro initially launched through the vision and ef forts of the Library’ s Information Literacy Director , Sara Tabaei , and Open Educational Resources (OER) Librarians Juliana Terciotti Magro, and Geor gia Westbrook. The initiative is currently co-led by Ms. Tabaei , Scholarly Communication & Data Librarian T imothy Valente, and OER & Instruction Librarian, Kirk Snyder , with the help and support of many others across T ouro. Introduction to Financial Analysis by Kenneth S. Bigel, is Open T ouro’ s first original OER publication. Further col- laborations with faculty author Dr . Bigel are forthcoming, the next of which, Corporate Finance ,is currently in pro- duction. Open T ouro wishes to thank the following individuals who served as blind reviewers for Introduction to Financial Analysis , providing invaluable feedback toward its improvement during the development process: Kenneth Abbott, Baruch College Sabra Brock, T ouro Universityxxii Kenneth S.Bigel xxii\\n\\nYiqin Chen, Baruch College Chayim Herskowitz, T ouro University Joseph Perlman, T ouro University Lall Ramrattan, University of California, Berkeley Exten- sion Michael Szenber g, Touro UniversityIntroduction toFinancial Analysis xxiii\\n\\nPreface Unique Pedagogical Style This text is written so that the reader can absorb relatively small bytes of information at a time without ever feeling overwhelmed. Each page is short and has a unique topical heading on which the student can focus and easily retain. The paragraphs are kept short, just as you will note they are on this page, to enable the reader to pause, take a breath, and review in his/her mind what s/he just read before going on. Occasionally , concepts and explanation are repeated in consecutive paragraphs in order to present an idea from multiple perspectives and to deepen one’ s comprehension. The writing style attempts to avoid jar gon, except where necessary . In such cases, the terminology is explained so that the reader may proceed with clarity . Still, there are many words and phrases that one must acquire in Finance. At times, vocabulary words are highlighted in the mar gins. Readers are advised to simultaneously press on the “CTRL” and “F” buttons at which time a window will open in which a search word may be entered. This will enable the reader to go back and review concepts at will. The chapters are or ganized and written so that the reader get directly to the point, without unnecessary information and “fluf f.” There is a certain flow to the chapters and sec- tions within the chapters that is intended to make learning smooth and enjoyable.xxiv Kenneth S.Bigel xxiv\\n\\nConcepts and Computations Financial Analysis, by and lar ge, incorporates Accounting concepts. Thus, it is imperative that the analyst understand the numbers, which s/he will utilize in his/her analysis. This text exposes the reader to the many shortcomings in reading Financial Statements. No prior knowledge of Accounting is assumed. The text, in its early chapters, will tenderly lead the reader through the arcane world of Accounting and point out the many shortcomings in read- ing the statements and in conducting elementary Financial Analysis. The reader should have some facility with very basic Alge- bra, in particular , s/he should be able to solve for an unknown in a simple formula, to be able to transpose a value from one side of an equation to the other , and to be to calculate exponents and roots. The text will make Alge- bra easy by showing, where necessary , the correct solutions step-by-step. The text will proceed to Ratio Analysis, the very basic tools of financial analysis, incorporating the previously learned Accounting data. It will then proceed to the notion of the Time V alue of Money , which is the central concept in all of finance. The text will conclude with Stock and Bond V al- uation, which are based on all the previous information of the text. Thus, the reader will build upon his/her knowledge by going from concept to concept in smooth, linear fashion, ever reaching for higher and higher planes of knowledge. <span style=”text-decoration: underline;”The Nuances of Financial Analysis Financial Analysis, at the end of the day , is just common sense, or common business sense. Financial and Mathe-Introduction toFinancial Analysis xxv\\n\\nmatical principles must conform to the realities of the field and not the other way around. The mathematics are a tool and not an end. In a sense, a financial analyst is bi-lingual; a student will translate financial principles into formulae when advised and can explain in plain English the mean- ing and application of such formulae when first presented with one. It is all supposed to make sense. This book tries to capture this dual and essential nature of Finance. As the reader goes through the text, s/he should increasingly gain a sense of empowerment, confidence, and mastery of the subject. Quotations The text is replete with quotations from an eclectic myriad of sources including the Bible, the T almud, great Greek philosophers, famous politicians, modern and popular thinkers from the 18th century onward, and more. The quo- tations are not intended to postulate or promote a point-of- view , especially where religion is concerned, but instead to inspire the reader to persevere in his/her study , to continue toward the achievement of great heights, and to always consider the social impact of his/her actions. Mastery of Finance presents a person with the opportunity to better oneself in so many ways while simultaneously bettering society-at-lar ge. And that is very cool. Problem-solving In virtually each chapter and ends-of chapters, the reader will find formulae to be solved, tables that need to be filled- in, and occasional diagrams to be drawn. The intent is to make the material come alive so that the student can both learn and test him/herself in the process. Solutions are gen- erally provided to all these fill-ins so that the reader mayxxvi Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nverify whether s/he resolved the problem correctly and may correct any errors in so doing.

Financial Statements and Ratio Analysis, and Forecasting Part I. Financial Statements and Ratio Analysis, and Forecasting Chapter 1: Introduction Chapter 2: Financial Statements Analysis: The Balance Sheet Chapter 3: Financial Statements Analysis: The Income Statement Chapter 4: Financial Statements and Finance1Kenneth S.Bigel 1\\n\\nChapter 1: IntroductionIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 2 2\\n\\n1.1 Chapter One: L earning Outcomes Learning Outcomes In this chapter , you will: •Imagine what a corporation is, its purpose, and how it is or ganized. •Identify the place of the Finance function within the corporation. •Distinguish between abstract and concrete rea- soning. •Formulate abstract hypotheses and statements. •Think deliberatively as a financial professional.3Kenneth S.Bigel 3\\n\\n1.2 The Corpor ation There are two ways of being happy: We must either diminish our wants or augment our means – either may do – the result is the same and it is for each man to decide for himself and to do that which hap- pens to be easier . -Benjamin Franklin What is a corporation? Y ou may have noticed that the Latin word “corpus” seems to appear within it. Indeed, it is a body! It is not human or animal, and it has no physical shape. Y ou cannot see it or touch it. It will have compo- nents that take physical form, such as a building or inven- tory, but the corporation itself is non-corporeal. So, what is it? It is a legal entity . It exists only as a legal construct. As such it is said that the corporation is a “per- son” under the law . It exists in a legal sense. It can be sued. It can be fined. It is owned by people who purchase own- ership interests in it. These interests or “claims” are called “shares” or “stock.” Owners are referred to as “sharehold- ers.” Shareholders have a claim on the company’ s profits. We may thus also refer to this type of corporation as a “stock corporation.” It is in business – generally speaking –Introduction toFinancial Analysis 4 4\\n\\nto make money for its shareholders, although it may serve other more altruistic purposes as well. The corporation, thus, as an independent person, is legally separate from the owners. The corporation may be sued for damages, but the owners may not be – unless the court determines that the owner is somehow legally liable for a wrong-doing himself and apart from the separate actions of the corporation. Therefore, the owners are protected from legal responsibilities. This does not absolve corporate man- agers from legal malfeasance if they did other wrongs, e.g., dumping waste illegally . One downside to the owners is that the corporation itself is a taxable entity . It pays income taxes and then the share- holders, once again, will pay income taxes on any profits distributed to them. These profit distributions are called “dividends.” W e class this “double taxation.” Of course, there are numerous other means by which a company may be or ganized in order to avoid double-tax- ation, but not all will provide the umbrella protection that the corporation provides. Y ou can learn about these busi- ness forms in a Management or T ax course.5Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n1.3 Business / Corpor ate Structure: The Management Organization It is well and fine, and critical, to learn what the Finance discipline’ s intellectual landmarks are, but the student cer- tainly wants to know how Finance fits into the actual cor- porate (business) context, which is the focus of this text. Here we shall see. The corporation will have both an “or ganizational struc- ture,” detailing the manner in which the firm actually operates and a capital structure, which is depicted on the Balance Sheet. W e will get to the Balance Sheet soon. First, the or ganization. There are four -six basic business functions in the or gani- zation: Introduction toFinancial Analysis 6 6\\n\\n1.4 The Finance F unction Within the Corpor ation The controller and treasurer of a company serve dif ferent functions, although these dif ferences may vary from firm to firm. Both report to the vice president of finance or chief financial of ficer (CFO). One of the two may also be the CFO, more probably the treasurer . There will be some variance in structure from company to company . The CFO reports to the Chief Operating Of ficer (COO) or to the Chief Executive Of ficer (CEO). Here are some typical functions of each.7Kenneth S.Bigel 7\\n\\nIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 8\\n\\n1.5 Capital Structure Above, we discussed the firm’ s organizational structure. This is how corporations operate. The firm will also have a “Capital Structure,” which will be represented on its Balance Sheet. The Balance Sheet will consist of Assets, Liabilities and Owners’ Equity . Assets are what the company owns, including inventory , plant and equipment, among other items. Liabilities are what the company owes to others including suppliers and lenders. Equity is the value of what the owners have invested in the company . Companies acquire Capital (Liabilities + Equity) in order to, in turn, “finance” (i.e., pay for) the acquisition and maintenance of its assets. Assets, in turn, are exploited to produce sales, which will – hopefully – deliver profits and a return to the shareholders, who are the owners of the corporation. The basic “accounting equation” is: Assets equals Liabili- ties plus Equity , or A = L + E. A Balance Sheet must, well, balance, as noted here. Assets will be on the left and Liabilities plus equity will be on the right – like the T en Commandments! In general,9Kenneth S.Bigel 9\\n\\nthe word “Capital” will refer to the right side of the Bal- ance Sheet. The firm’ s Capital is not free; it has an eco- nomic cost; lenders expect interest on its loans to the company and shareholders expect dividends and the growth of dividends of their equity investment in the firm. The economic cost of the firm’ s capital represents the return to lenders and stock investors. Where there is a return to investors (lenders and owners), there must be a cost to the corporation who provides the return. T wo sides to the same coin. In order to be competitive, a corporation must also cover its “Opportunity Cost.” If an investor in the corporation can earn a better return in an equivalent alternative investment, s/he will choose the better alternative. This is a basic prin- ciple of Economics. The corporation, in order to be able to attract investment, must therefore cover its Opportunity Costs, i.e., the alternative return an investor gives up when making an investment in this corporation. We will discuss the Balance Sheet further in depth on the pages to follow . For now , let’s re-wire our brains so that we think like Financial Economists.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 10\\n\\nKey Terms: Abstract Abstrac- tion Simplifica- tion1.6 Thinking Lik e an Economist: Abstr action Economics, and its of fspring, Finance, are abstract (social) sciences. In order to study economics, it is essential that one understands what an abstraction is. An abstraction is an idea, intended to mir- ror reality in its simplest form. The world is a very complicated place; there are many variables or inputs, some identifi- able, others not, that af fect an outcome, and which we endeavor to identify . In order to understand the outcome which is generally true, but not necessarily absolutely or always so, one must engage in a process of simplification that requires removing minor variables from a general idea in order to reduce the notion to its essential characteristics. Indeed, the Latin word, “abstract,” comes from “drawing” or “taking away from.” The ever -changing kaleidoscope of raw r eality11 Kenneth S.Bigel 11\\n\\nFirst Prin- ciples Ceteris Paribus All else equal Default Assump- tion Premisewould defeat the human mind by its complexity , except for the mind’ s ability to abstract, to pick out parts and think of them as a whole. Thomas Sowell A Conflict of V isions (2002), p. 5 In this process, one is able to derive a broad, general conclusion, based on first principles from which is derived a gen- eral idea or rule. In economics, this requires a ceteris paribus assumption, that is to say , holding “ all else equal .” Initially , it is assumed that no other vari- ables matter and are thus ignored away . It takes some discipline to do this at first, but it quickly becomes easy; you must merely keep it in mind. In circumstances where little given or known information may be at hand, one must assume reasonable default assumptions , i.e., premises , which make sense in general and in the simplest, most com- mon form possible. While it may be facile toIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 12\\n\\nDialectical Reasoning Mode of Reasoning Thesis/ Antithesis/ Synthesisimagine other considerations, or variables, that may come into play , one must avoid doing this, in order to focus on just a few key variables, which af fect the outcome. Here is a relevant comment by Dr . Milton Friedman1 : A hypothesis is important if it “explains” much by little, that is, if it abstracts the common and cru- cial elements fr om the mass of complex and detailed circumstances surr ounding the phenomena to be explained and permits valid pr edictions on the basis ofthem alone. To be important, ther efore, a hypoth- esis must be descriptively false in its assumptions; it takes account of, and accounts for , none of the many other attendant cir cumstances, since its very success shows them to be irr elevant for the phenom- ena to be explained…. To be sure, Dr . Friedman’ s comments are not without criticism, but nevertheless are adhered to, by and lar ge, in the social sci- ences, including, of course, economics. In certain other disciplines, including law , political theory , history , philosophy , and possibly others, we do not engage in this mode of r easoning . In these fields, by contrast, we are often engaged in dialec- tical r easoning . There, we first state a thesis , then examine its antithesis . We go back and forth numerous times until we can arrive at a synthesis , which is conclu- sive or dispositive. 1.Friedman, Milton. (1953). Essays in Positive Economics. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. pp. 14-15.13 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nDescrip- tive Contextual Concrete Generaliz- ableThose of you that are accustomed to dialectical reasoning must diligently avoid the natural instinct to quickly imag- ine the antithesis; rather you must remain steadfast to the line of reasoning demanded by the more linear manner of abstract ar gumentation, based on first principles and ceteris paribus delimitations. (A “delimitation” is a limitation that one person herself imposes on the scope of her reasoning.) When, in certain instances, we deviate from abstract reasoning, we assume spe- cific, more descriptive , circumstances in acontextual or“concr ete” manner . The result may not be generalizable . If a con- clusion is generalizable, we say that it is true in the overwhelming number of instances, although not necessarily all. For instance, it is known via mathematics and reason, that interest rates and stock prices are inversely related. Rates go up, prices go down. This is true beyond any doubt – if we assume ceteris paribus. At the same time, it is more than just interest rates alone that af fect stock prices. One of the beauties of abstract reasoning is that it enables us to employ other , more reasonable assumptions when we find that a model has poor predictive power .

Sorry – one last discussion. It is that important. Here’ s a relevant joke: A chemist, a physicist, and an economist are stranded on a desert island. They have an ample supply of canned food, but alas, no can opener . The chemist suggests that they should light a fire under the cans so that they would burst open. The physicist suggests dropping the cans from the clif f to its rocky bottom to smash them open. The economist declares: “Let’ s assume we have a can opener .” Financial and economic theory makes, what may appear at first, some absurd assumptions. But that is only because the social world, the world inhabited by people, is far more complex, in many ways, than the real world, the world of the hard sciences. Are the chemist’ s molecules motivated by fear and greed? Will ambition or altruism af fect the trajectory of the falling cans? Economists cannot keep track of every alternative that the human mind may consider , so it abstracts by look- ing into the outcomes or choices that are usually indepen-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 16 16\\n\\ndent of human foibles, or dare I say ,are“logical.” Without abstraction, economists would never arrive at any general- izations. We would therefore learn nothing! Zilch. Suppose you just arrived in New Y ork City for the first time. If you wish to find T imes Square, would you use a map (imagine that there is no GPS or W aze) that details all the streets, or just the main arteries? No! Y ou would not be concerned with all the confusing, and mostly useless, details. A bur geoning field, Behavioral Economics and Finance, deals with the human condition and its interaction with tra- ditional, “objective” economics. However , first things first. Being ignorant is not so much a shame, as being unwilling to learn. -Benjamin Franklin Instruct me and I shall be silent.

How to Engage in Abstract or Analytic Reasoning Analytic ar gumentation dif fers markedly from Dialectical. The following pertains to the Analytic method only . Keep it in mind. 1.Analytic reasoning commences with a first prin- ciple or assumption. On this foundation, an “argument” is built. ◦Assumptions must be reasonable and generally true. 2.An ar gument is not a debate. Do not start with an oppositional counter -statement . It is not about “winning.”Introduction toFinancial Analysis 18 18\\n\\n3.Do not spar with the ar gument. First try to understand it. ◦Taking a contrary position willnotassist you in understanding the proposition or ar gument better . 4.Arguments are often nuanced, not black and white. 5.An ar gument is not an opinion. The latter is sub- jective. 6.In college (and later in life), an opinion is not necessarily a “right” to which a student is “enti- tled.” Sound reasoning, i.e., a good ar gument, trumps opinion. 7.Any position you take must be based on sound argument. The T almudic method invariably pr efers to pose questions in a concr ete rather than an abstract form. –Rabbi Adin Even-Israel Steinsaltz Refer ence Guide to the T almud , p. 131 (2014) We can safely assert that if one applies a lit match to a piece pf paper , the paper will burn. This is true in general and assumes that all else is equal. BUT what IF it is raining? What IF the paper is treated with a fire retardant? Do these,19 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nsomewhat absurd violations of our ceteris paribus postu- late negate the veracity of the general principle that paper burns? Here the word “BUT” is oppositional. The word “IF” creates a concrete context, a narrow circumstance, with the, often unconscious, purpose of finding reason to deny a generally sound principle, e.g., that paper burns.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 20\\n\\n1.9 Finance Style Students very often will come to their first finance class well-read in an impressive host of subjects, including his- tory, literature, and more, but not necessarily in economics or finance. Finance, as certain other “scientific” subjects, is written in a markedly dif ferent style; it is notably terse and succinct. Words are not parsed, and expansive, colorful prose is con- sistently eschewed. Sparse, precise language is the rule. Unlike literature, for instance, one may find that s/he has to read the same sentence several times until s/he gets it. Y ou just can’ t put your feet up, and slice through many pages in relatively short order . Do not get frustrated when this happens. Kick around the notions discussed in your head, until you get it. Then kick it over again; you may find that you can see the same thing from dif ferent angles with increasing thought. That should invigorate you. Start thinking in Abstract T erms – like a Financial Economist. Spend extra time on each paragraph and page. Y ou may find that you have to substantially slow down the pace of your reading. As formulae are presented, carefully check the calculations to be sure you agree. Y ou will find this extremely helpful21 Kenneth S.Bigel 21\\n\\nin increasing your understanding and insight. Always keep your calculator handy as you read. Be methodical and take your time. Y ou will find that you will adjust to the new style, and you will find enjoyment in your increasing mastery!

Finance begins where the Certified Public Accoun- tant’s job ends. The accountant’ s job is to carefully exam- ine the company’ s financial records (its “books”) in order first to determine their accuracy and veracity . The accoun- tant will then simplify the data and summarize them into three Financial Statements: The Balance Sheet, The Income Statement, and the Cash Flow Statement. In this text we will deal only with the first two statements. The accountant does not have completely free rein regard- ing the manner in which the financial data are summarized. S/he must abide by “Generally Accepted Accounting Prin- ciples”, also known simply as GAAP . This is the rulebook for the accounting profession. GAAP rules are set by the accounting profession’ s rule-making body , the Financial Accounting Standards Board (F ASB). The accounting pro- fession in turn, derives its legal status from a federal gov- ernment or ganization called the Security and Exchange Commission or “SEC.” By law , the SEC empowers the accounting profession to make its own rules and to police the rules – with the SEC’ s oversight. As many of you may already know , the SEC also oversees the United States’ financial markets. All Financial Statements, including the Balance Sheet, will be provided to lenders who will examine the statements25 Kenneth S.Bigel 25\\n\\nprior to making any lending determinations. “Public Com- panies,” i.e., corporations whose stock is “traded” (bought and sold) on a public stock exchange where stock is bought and sold, are required to release their statement sto anyone who request sthem. Again, t his is an SEC requirement. The skilled financial analyst will then read the statements because s/he is an “interested party ”and wants to know whether an investment in the company is well and fine or whether a potential investment may be advised . S/he may represent lenders or equity shareholders ; either party may be considered “investors. ”Reading the statements requires advanced education concerning how the accoun- tant comp iled the statements. GAAP rules are quite com- plex. In summary , the accountant is a trained historian of sorts. The financial analyst will read the accountant’ s end-prod- uct but is more future oriented. The latter is only concerned about how a potential investment will perform in the future.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 26\\n\\n2.3 The Balance Sheet TheBalance Sheet presents a static, unchanging, still-pho- tograph of a company’ s financial position at a moment in time, i.e., “as of” a certain date, often December 31st. In theory , any of the figures on the balance sheet would be different, either lar ger or smaller , on the very first day fol- lowing (or before) the statement date. The Balance Sheet is usually issued every quarter , i.e., every three months. A very simple balance sheet will look something like the fol- lowing (with the numbers filled in). Take note that any actual Balance Sheet you may examine may dif fer from this simple example. XYZ C orp. Balance Sheet as of 12.31.X X All Asset accounts are “debit balance” accounts. That means that when the account increases (decreases), the amount is recorded on the debit (credit) side of the firm’ s ledger . Liability and Equity Accounts are “credit balance” accounts. We make these entries into the bookkeeper ’s ledger ’s “T -Accounts” (see immediately below). This27 Kenneth S.Bigel 27\\n\\nmechanistic framework is fundamental to “double-entry book-keeping.” Let’s repeat this: Asset accounts are “debit balance” (debit = “Dr”) accounts, whereas liability and owners’ (or share- holders’) equity are “credit balance” (credit = “Cr”) accounts. Increases (decreases) in asset accounts are char- acterized by debit (credit) entries; increases (decreases) in liability and equity accounts are characterized by credit (debit) entries. In “double-entry” bookkeeping, for every debit entry there must be a credit entry . Debits must equal credits, and the balance sheet must balance: T otal Assets = T otal Liabilities + Equity . This is the basic accounting equation. Basic accounting equation : The following equations must, by definition, be true: A = L + E (Assets = Liabilities plus Equity) A – L = E (Assets minus Liabilities = Equity) There are also contra-asset accounts (such as accumulated depreciation and allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables), which are “credit balance” (credit = Cr) accounts. These contra-accounts ef fectively reduce the (net) asset accounts and are credit entries. The phrase “current,” as in “current assets,” has to do with the life of the asset – or liability . According to the accoun-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 28\\n\\ntant, any asset (or liability), which is consumed (or paid) within an accounting period (i.e., one year), is current. Any asset – or liability – that has a life exceeding one year is “long-term.” Thus, inventory is placed “above the line,” under current assets. So too is the case with accounts payable. Property is long-term, for example. More on this next….29 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n2.4 Sample Bookk eeping Entries Here are some examples of simple bookkeeping (or “jour- nal” or “ledger”) entries, exemplifying double-entry book- keeping standards. Keep in mind that assets are debit balance accounts, while liabilities and equity are credit bal- ance accounts. Debits must always equal credits. (All the numbers below are in thousands of dollars.) 1.Let’s say that a company buys inventory for $1,000 in cash. What are the correct bookkeep- ing entries? You will note that cash goes down (credit) and inventory goes up (debit). You will note that the basic accounting equation (A = L + E) remains unchanged. 2.What happens when a company borrows money by issuing long-term debt for $5,000? First, debt increases (credit) and so too will cash (debit). You will note that both sides of the the basic accounting equation increase. 3.What if the company borrows $7,500 in order toIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 30 30\\n\\nbuy back some of its stock? Debt increases (credit) and equity goes down (debit). Thepurchased equity becomes what is called “T reasury Stock,” which is a contra- account and thus a debit balance account. The equity may be reissued again in the future, should the company choose to do so. Another example of a contra-account would be “Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receiv- ables, ”which would be a credit balance account versus accounts receivables. 4.What happens when the company buys $500 in inventory on credit terms? Inventory rises (debit) and payables also increase (credit).31 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n2.5 Current Assets: In ventory and Accounts Receivable The accountant defines the word, “current,” as in “current asset” – or “current liability” – as an item, which is con- sumed or exhausted within one calendar year . On the bal- ance sheet, we observe numerous such assets and liabilities. For example, inventory is held by the corpora- tion for sale in the near future and, presumably , is sold in less than one year (in most instances). In fact, the sooner the corporation disposes of its inventory the better , by and large. “Accounts receivable” is a current asset that bears some further explanation. In many instances, a customer pays for goods purchased at the point of sale. He receives the goods (i.e., the corporation’ s inventory) and pays at the same time.That is what usually happens when consumers buy goods at the store. At the time of (a “cash”) sale, the seller reduces inventory (credit) and increases cash (debit). In many , if not most, lar ge business transactions, the cus- tomer may receive the goods, but not pay for them until later. The seller may grant the customer “credit” for the purchase and require “terms of sale” to which the buyer agrees. The terms of sale will dictate that the customer pay for the goods, typically , but not always, within thirty days of delivery . This sale would be referred to as a “credit sale” rather than a “cash sale,” and would be indicated as such on the company’ s income statement (see below).Introduction toFinancial Analysis 32 32\\n\\nAt the time of the credit sale, the seller will record, or “book,” an account receivable for the sale on its balance sheet, while the buyer will book an account payable on its. Simultaneously , the seller reduces (i.e., credits) his inven- tory and the buyer increases (i.e., debits) his. When payment is made, the accounts receivable are adjusted (as will the cash account). In the case of the seller , the account receivable is reduced (i.e., credited) and the cash account will be increased (i.e., debited). In the case of the buyer , the account payable will be reduced (i.e., debited) and cash will be reduced (i.e., cred- ited) as well.33 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n2.6 Financial Claims Hier arch y Lenders and owners have dif ferent claims on the com- pany’ s interests. There is a distinct hierarchy in which the corporation’ sclaimants get paid – in order from first to last: Debtholders (Lenders) : They get paid first. This includes the interest on loans, and on the loan’ s principal when due. Loan payments are made as contracted, and do not increase should the firm become more profitable. Dividends may not be paid to shareholders unless loan payments have been made first, and in full. Preferred shareholders : These owners (usually) get paid a fixed payment or “dividend,” which cannot increase even if the firm’ s profits increase. If the firm is unable to pay the dividend it may skip it. However , most preferred dividends are “cumulative,” which means that no common stock div- idends may be paid unless and until all past unpaid divi- dends that have accumulated “in arrears” are paid in full first. Common shareholders : These shareholders get their divi- dends last, and are ef fective owners of any earnings, which the firm does not pay out, but “retains” and reinvests back into the firm in the manner of added property , plant, equip- ment, and working capital. In other words, common share- holders have a claim on the firm’ s net income (after preferred dividends have been paid).Introduction toFinancial Analysis 34 34\\n\\nCommon shareholders take on the most risk as they are last ones “on the totem pole.” Such is the case whether the firm is an ongoing enterprise or is being liquidated in bankruptcy . They get paid last. Common shareholders have a “residual” claim, or interest, in the company – after all other interests are taken care of. On the other hand, the common shareholders have the most to gain if the firm is profitable; the dividend may be increased and more earnings may be retained – to their financial benefit, as the firm’ s “retained earnings” are owned by the common shareholders. Again, only common shareholders benefit if profits go up; common share ownership entails more risk, since if interest and preferred dividends are not paid, there may be nothing left for the common shareholders. Government and T axes: Let’ s not for get that, after interest has been paid, the earnings of the company are then taxed, and that dividends are paid out of Net Income – after taxes have been paid. T axes are a given, and normally , we do not think of the government as a claimant on the firm, since it is neither lender nor owner . Nothing is certain except death and taxes. -Benjamin Franklin35 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 36\\n\\n2.7 Interest P aid on Bonds and Dividends P aid on Stock •Interest on debt is tax deductible to the corpora- tion; dividends on preferred and com- mon stocks are not tax-deductible , under current law. ◦Interest must be paid before any divi- dend payments on preferred and com- mon stocks may be made. •Preferred stock dividends are usually fixed (like the interest on most bonds). Even if the corpora- tion becomes more profitable, the preferred stock dividend cannotbe increased. There is no upside, in this case. ◦Only a fter interest is paid on the cor- poration’ s debt, may preferred divi- dends then be paid. If the dividend is not paid, it is not consid ered a “default” as with a loan or debt; this is because preferred stock represents ownershi p interests and not aliability . Preferred stock is thus thought of as a hybrid debt/equity security as it has characteristics of both . ◦Most preferred shares are “cumula- tive,” which means that before any dividends are paid to common share-37 Kenneth S.Bigel 37\\n\\nholders, all those preferred divi- dends thathave not been paid, and are thus said to have accumulated unpaid or“in arrears ,”must first be paid2. •Common stock is most risky – first, because its dividends are thelast to be paid and sec- ondly ,because common shareholders are thelast tobe paid of f in bankruptcy (thus the phrase “residual interest,” used above) . ◦However ,as common shareholders have rights to “ residual ” profits (i.e., after interest is paid on debt and, sec- ond, after preferred stock dividend distributions) that the firm ma y gener- ate,common shareholders alsohave the most opportunity to share in positive earnings growth , i.e., they have the most to gain . ◦As a result, c ommon shares usually come with “voting rights,” i.e., the ability annually to vote for company management and on certain key issues. Notably preferred shares rarely carry such rights.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 38\\n\\n2.8 Bankruptcy Many students think that bankruptcy is a death knell. It is not – necessarily . It can actually be a good thing, which ensures the survival of an enterprise that experienced finan- cial stress. There are dif ferent forms of bankruptcy . The forms are categorized by “chapters,” under T itle 1 1 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Let’ s briefly see what the principal bankruptcy forms are, as noted in the Code by chapter , and how each form is dif ferent. Chapter 7 : This bankruptcy form allows debtors to eliminate most or all of their debts over a short period of time, often just a few months. Only student loans, child support payments and some other debts may survive. Here, atrustee is appointed who then liquidates unsecured debts and makes the proper distributions. Collateral on secured debt may berepossessed. Certain assets will be protected, such as social security insurance. T o qualify for Chapter 7, the debtor must satisfy a “means test.” If the test is not satis- fied, the debtor may seek relief under Chapter 13. Chapter 1 1: Here, the debtor retains ownership and control of assets. The debtor is referred to as a “debtor in possession.” The “DIP” runs the day-to-day af fairs of the business while the creditors work with the bankruptcy court to work out a plan to be made whole. If the creditors come to an agreement,39 Kenneth S.Bigel 39\\n\\nthe business continues operating and certain agreed-upon payments are made. If there is no agreement, the court intercedes; debtors filing a second time are referred to as Chapter 22 filers. Chapter 13 : In this form, debtors retain ownership and possession of the assets (in contrast to Chapter 7), andwill make payments to a trustee from future earnings ,which will then be dis- bursed to creditors. There is a five-year limit in which this process must be completed . Secured creditors may receive larger payments. Students’ take-away :Bankruptcy is not always the end of the story . Advice :One should consult with an attorney to obtain detailed, actionable information regarding these complex laws. Question :In the Banking Crisis of 2008, the United States government rescued, or bailed out, General Motors; it purchased stock in the company , using taxpayer funds. W as that the right move? W ould it have been better for Uncle Sam to have allowed the corporation to fail and file under the Bankruptcy Code?Introduction toFinancial Analysis 40\\n\\n2.9 The Balance Sheet, Net Income, and the Common Shareholder Net income is an Income Statement number , which is also very relevant to the balance sheet. What happens to net income –or profits –after it is recorded? Let’ s say the company records net income of $1million for the year . If the company pays dividends to its shareholders of, say $100,000, those funds are now theirs and not the corporation’ s. The shareholders are enriched to the extent of $100,000 (less taxes). This leaves $900,000 in “addition to retained earnings,” which at the year ’s end will be transferred by the accoun- tantfrom the income statement to the retained earnings account in the equity section of the balance sheet. (This is done when the accountant “closes out the books” at year ’s end, at which time the income statement reverts to zero.) Of course, as owners of the corporation, all retained earnings, in fact, belong to the common shareholders as well. Thus, from the point of view of the balance sheet, the common shareholders own both the “common stock” and the “retained earnings.” The preferred shareholders justown the preferred stock. 41 Kenneth S.Bigel 41\\n\\n2.10 Corpor ate Goals It is well known that in a Capitalist economy , the corpora- tion is said to serve the interests of the owners. (While there may be additional purposes, we shall assume this simple premise.) The owners wish to earn prof- its,to“make money .”In theory , we shall assume that the owners and, by extension, the corporation has a never - ending appetite for profits and corporate growth. W e shall say that the corporation has no interest in vacation, rest, or“doing good,” the lack of which premises may , in fact, befalse. “Growth,” thus, refers to the increase in a corporation’ s sales or revenues, which in turn provide increasing levels of profits to the benefit of the corporation’ s owners. This brings us to the Balance Sheet. No company can produce sales without assets. It is assets (the left side of the Balance Sheet) that produce goods and services for sale. However , assets must be paid for , or more accurately , “financed” when cash itself is unavailable. The financing of the company’ s assets comes from raising capital in the form of liabilities, including borrowed money ,and injections of cash from owners who purchase shares of equity in the corporation when such shares areoffered by the corporation. (This is distinctly dif ferent from secondary market trading where shares are bought from selling shareholders with no corporate involve- ment.) Financing sources also include profits which the company retains – “Retained Earnings.”Introduction toFinancial Analysis 42 42\\n\\nAs the company increases its capital, it is then equipped to acquire more assets with which to increase its sales and profits ad infinitum. Thus, as the balance sheet itself increases, so too does the potential for corporate growth as we define it. Round and round she goes.43 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n2.11 W ords and Numbers (An Aside ) In business and perhaps in Finance in particular , memoriza- tion is less important than active, creative thinking. Some people find math intimidating, but it does not have to be. By and lar ge, Finance does not require the memorization of formulas. However , one must understand the mathematics. This is an important distinction. If you regard formulas as memorization, it may become an unpleasant and, worse, a dif ficult task. Instead, think of formulas as shorthand explanations of the relationships between important finan- cial concepts, between prices and interest rates, for exam- ple. If this is done, the relationships will seem clear and logical, and memorization should prove unnecessary , or at least, less so. Some people consider themselves word- rather than num- ber-persons. Think of numbers as words! Indeed, they are linguistically meaningful. Mathematical symbols are a shorthand way of saying something that can also be said – at greater length – in words. Over the course of the semester , the student will be exposed to numerous mathematical formulae.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 44 44\\n\\nDo not worry about your difficulties in mathemat- ics; I can assur e you mine ar e still even gr eater . -Albert Einstein45 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n2.12 Chapter 2 Re view Questions Chapter 2: Review Questions 1.Is the Balance Sheet a “flow” or a “static” state- ment?

The income statement will reflect cumula- tive data for a period ending on a certain date. The “period” has a starting and ending date; it may cover a year , half- year, quarter , or even a month. Over the course of the period, the numbers, whether they be revenues or expenses, will grow only lar ger. The sole exception to this is the profit figures, including gross prof- its, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and net income. These data may go either up or down depending on the relative growth of the revenues and expenses that make up those “net” figures. That is, if revenues grew less than expenses over a period, the net profit may go down over time. T ake note that expenses are bracketed numbers to indicate that they are subtractions from revenue in order to arrive at profits. Again, all other entries are the result of the accountant’ s summarization of revenue and expense bookkeeping entries, which only grow in size over time (with some few exceptions). Profits are merely the calculation of dif- ferences between revenues and expenses in the summary income statement. If expenses grow faster than revenues, profits may decrease in time. In contrast, balance sheet numbers will change, in theory ,51 Kenneth S.Bigel 51\\n\\nKey Terms: Common Size State- mentsdaily , and may either increase or decrease. At the year ’s end, the “books are closed” and all the income statement numbers revert to zero; we start all over again. The balance sheet, in contrast, never reverts to zero; the company always has some assets and liabilities. A very simple income statement will look something like the following: XYZ Corp. Income Statement for the Y ear Ending 12.31.XX You must note that expenses are brack- eted as they are reductions (subtractions) to revenue in arriving at the profits num- bers, i.e., Gross Profits, EBIT , and Net Income. The key connection between the income statement and balance sheet has lar gely to do with “addition to retained earnings.” When the books are “closed” at year ’s end, this addition (or deduction) is trans- ferred to “retained earnings” in the bal-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 52\\n\\nance sheet; the income statement is “closed out,” and everything in the income statement reverts back to zero. If dividends are paid when there is a loss, the cash used to pay the dividends will have to come from (past years’) retained earnings. “Retained earnings” represent the accu- mulation of historically retained profits, which were not paid out as dividends, but instead were retained by the cor- poration, since the corporation’ s inception. As an accountant (or financial analyst), you may think of revenues as credits (right hand) and expenses as debits (left hand) of the “T -accounts” to which reference was made in the prior chapter . Think of the income statement as part of the balance sheet’ s equity section, which is also a credit balance account. When numbers are compared to a base figure, in this case either “total revenues” or “Net Income,” the analysis may be referred to as “V ertical Analysis.” This makes the analysis from one company to another sim- pler. Matters having to do with the relative magnitude of the data from one company to another are thereby neu- tralized. Such analysis utilizes Common Size Statements , where figures are represented in percentage terms, as in the income statement above. Common size statements are also (very occasionally) used for Balance Sheets. Getting back to debits and credits, at year ’s end, the accountant debits the income statement for an amount equal to the “addition to retained earnings.” Remember that the Income Statement is a credit balance statement. This debiting enables the accountant to set the income state- ment back to zero. (Again, the balance sheet never reverts to zero, except in the extreme case of bankruptcy liquida- tion.) S/he then credits the balance sheet’ s retained earn- ings account for this same amount. That is how retained53 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nCredit Sales S, G, & Aearnings grow (or decrease when there is a loss and retained earnings are thus negative) over time. The addi- tions to earnings should be reinvested by a good manage- ment in profitable assets for corporate growth purposes. “EBIT” may also be referred to as “operating earnings.” As you will see, we will dif ferentiate between operating earnings, i.e., earnings generated from the firm’ s business activities, and other non-operating income. There are a few other basic things that the financial analyst must keep in mind relative to the Income Statement. Credit sales (on the income statement) are recorded as accounts receivable (on the balance sheet) – until the receivables are collected. This is typical of accrual accounting, as opposed to cash account- ing, the latter of which recognizes a sale only when cash is exchanged. At the time of a credit sale, credit sales are “credited” on the books, and accounts receivable are debited. When the customer pays, say in 30 days, the account receivable is credited and the cash account is debited. Selling expenses include advertising, salesperson’ s salaries, and “freight-out” paid on shipments to customers; an excep- tion is “freight-in” payments, which are paid on shipments to the firm and are included in COGS (cost of goods sold). General and administrative expenses have to do with: clerical and executive of fices salaries, outside professional services, tele- phone and internet, postage, and of fice equipment depreci-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 54\\n\\nDeprecia- tion Imputableation. Selling, General, and Administrative expenses are also known as S, G, & A . Depr eciation , ifimputable to inventory production, will be included in COGS. By “imputable,” it is meant that the accoun- tant can objectively ascribe a specified dollar amount of depreciation to a speci- fied dollar amount of production. Imputable means that units produced can be associated and measured with mathe- matical certainty and precision to units of production. This figure would be added to COGS, rather than reported separately lower down on the Income Statement. For example, if an equipment manufacturer warrants that a $1 million-dollar machine (at cost) will produce one mil- lion units and then need to be scrapped, we can safely say that each unit produced includes one dollar ’s worth of depreciation. This may happen in the case of depreciable equipment, but not with the plant. Otherwise, i.e., if not imputable, depreciation will be reflected separately and visibly below the gross profit line. This makes matters confusing to the reader .Depreciation may be included “above” (within COGS) and/or “below” the gross profits line (as “depreciation expense”). If the for- mer, it will be included within theCOGS number; if not, it should be reflected as a separate line item lower down the income statement.55 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nEBIT Operating EarningsEBIT orOperating Earnings should be viewed as a kind of dividing line within the income statement. Everything “above the line,” has to do with the firm’ s basic running of the business, or operating rev- enues and expenses. Those items that appear “below the line” may include numerous non-operating items. Such items may include interest on debt, a profit or loss from the sale of an asset, or the financial outcome of litigation. Inter- est (on debt) has to do with a financial matter; this is not a matter having to do with the running of the business, but instead, with the decision as to how the firm’ s assets are financed, in this case with debt rather than with equity . Analytically , it is important to the financial analyst to dif ferentiate between operating and non-operat- ing; we shall depend on this dif ferentiation often. Taxes are based on earnings before taxes (EBT), which are not always shown on income statements as a separate line item. Here, EBT , i.e., EBIT ($4,500) less interest expense ($500), but before taxes, equals $4,000. Y ou should also note that taxes were calculated using a 30% tax rate (i.e., a rate arbitrarily chosen for this example), i.e., $4,000 × 30% = $1,200.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 56\\n\\n57 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n3.3 On L earning and Studying Torah learning is best combined with an occupa- tion/pr ofession, because the effort of both will keep one fr om sin.

Accounting presentations complicate analysis, and in par- ticular make dif ficult the use of analytic financial ratios , which are compiled from the accounting data .Hence, financial analysis is not straightforward, as it would other- wise be if the numerical bases of the accounting data were themselves not subject to variation over time and from firm to firm, an dthus to – interpretation! Historical bias –In most, but not all cases, asset cost is recorded by the accountant based on invoiced ,historical values .Such costs are determined at a point in time and are not adjusted upward later for changing , and possibly increasing, market val ues. (These assets may then be depreciated, adding still further to the dif ficulty in interpre- tation.) For example, in the case of long-term assets, a building may be built (or purchased )at a(historical) costof $1 mil- lion dollars. Another , virtually identical building, whichIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 60 60\\n\\nmay be built (or purchased ) by the same company some years later could have a cost of $2 million; the newer building costs more due to inflation and/or market condi- tions. The accountant will not necessarily show the details of the original costs of each property and the respective depreciation schedules for each property separately . The accountant will carry the building ’svalue at its original cost,and at a combined sum, in this case of $3 mil- lion, leaving the reader of the data with a kind of mixed bag of information. Secondly , thedepreciation expense will be based on this original value. Market values of buildings often , in fact, exceed therecorded, “book ”carrying values , i.e., historical cost minus accumulated depreciation .The accountant will not adjust the carrying value of such an asset upward ,thereby makingit dif ficult to know the asset’ s,andtherefore the company’ s,true worth. This is not an issue where current assets are concerned. It certainly does not apply to cash or accounts receivable; these values do not change. (Under certain narrowly defined circumstances, cash equivalents, a.k .a., “mar- ketable securities” values may be adjusted.) Inventory is generally not marked down in value and never marked up, under accounting rules. Estimates –This toowill be illustrated (below) with the use of the(same )example of long-term asset accounting . We will examine both the asset’ s “ salvage value ”andtheasset ’sestimated “ life,”both of which are estimated. This leaves ample room for “judgment” and , hence, earnings manipulation. Other examples may also pertain.61 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nReserves –For example, management has some leeway in setting up loss accounts or“reserves ,”e.g., for “uncol- lectible accounts receivable ,”better known as “allowance for doubtful accounts.” We will not demonstrate this phe- nomenon; suf fice it to say that this is a notable problem where accounting “manipulation” is concerned. While reserves have been listed here as a category by itself, the reader may also think of it as an example of an estimate. Arbitrary use of cost or other methods – The accountant (together with company management) has alternatives regarding themanner in which s/hemay choose to “cost” certain items. This will be illustrated (below) with respect to inventory (a “current asset”) and long-term asset accounting, including plant and equipment. Y ou must recall that “property ,” i.e., land cannot be depreciated. An external financial analyst must dig below the surface inorder to understand the accountant’ s summary of the corporation ’s ledgers. He must also have a deep under- standing of the nature of the industry in which the cor- poration operates .A good place to start is by reading the accountant’ s footnotes and thoroughly understanding the firm’ sGAAP reporting policies. “GAAP” refers to “gener- ally accepted accounting principles,” which are the rules to which accountants must adhere.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 62\\n\\n3.5 The Audit Now that we know what financial statements are, and what set of problems may ensue in readings statements, it is important to know well what the accountant’ s role relative to the production of the statements is. Certified Public Accountants (C.P.A.s) examine , i.e., “audit,” the books , ledgers, and records of corporations in order to ascertain the data entries’ veracity and accuracy ,andprepare sum- mary financial statements such as those we have seen in ourBalance Sheet andIncome Statement discussions .The statements are , once again, summaries of myriad , and often complex, transactions that occurred within the corporationover the course of the stated period – for the Income Statement, or“as of ”a date noted – in the case of the Balance Sheet. The auditors will present one of four possible “opinions” about the statements. The analyst should examine the opin- ion for information concerning the accuracy and compre- hensiveness of the statements’ data prior to reading the statements themselves. 1.Unqualified Opinion: This is the ideal opinion and is considered a “complete audit.” The results are satisfactory , and the statements are “fairly presented” in the language of the auditor/ accountant. 2.Unqualified Opinion with Explanatory Para- graph: This may be a complete audit, but the auditor believes that additional information is63 Kenneth S.Bigel 63\\n\\nrequired. 3.Qualified Opinion: In general, the statements are fairly presented with an important exception that does not af fect the statements as a whole. This generally occurs when there is an unjusti- fied deviation from “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,” or GAAP . This opinion falls short of “Adverse.” 4.Adverse Opinion: The auditor does not feel that the statements taken as a whole fairly pre- sent the corporation’ s financial position in con- formity with GAAP accounting.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 64\\n\\n3.6 P erpetual In ventory Accounting There are two such counting (“Accounting”) methods for inventory – “perpetual” and “periodic.” Aperpetual inven- tory counting system is usually used where the inventory units are few in number ,and high in unit cost. It thus pays for the firm’ s management to spend some extra resources in knowing exactly how many yachts , for example, it has in the showroom. A one-unit dif ference is substantial. Under this system, the firm knows –at all times –the dollar value of its inventory .There are certain method sunder which a perpetual system accounts for its inventory ,includ- ing“specific identification, ”whereby each physical inventory unit is associated with its own specific cost. In contrast, a periodic inventory system is effective where units are numerous and relatively cheap. Manage- ment is not going to be able to justify the extra ef fort required to know whether there are ten or eleven blue pens instock, more or less . It will do, instead, a periodic , prob- ably annually , physical audit of what’ s down there in the warehouse. When a physical audit is done, the counting is done in units, rather than in dollars. Thus, the ascription of units to dollars is subject to methodological choice. When a company uses a periodic system, there are manage- ment choices under legitimate accounting rules by which the accountant may record the ending inventory balance and, hence, cost of goods sold figures – in dollars . Wewill illustrate all this below .Upon the completion of which65 Kenneth S.Bigel 65\\n\\nanalysis, the analyst’ s relevant interpretive issues should become clear . The dif ferences in the numbers presented, and the related management strategies as related to the choice of cost method, are potentially markedly dif ferent. Let’s read on.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 66\\n\\n3.7 P eriodic In ventory Analysis: Ending Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold Let’s assume a company’ s books reflect the following accounting data: We know the beginning inventory dollar figure because it is carried over from the prior period’ s end ing value as noted on the Balance Sheet . The purchasing manager will have loads of invoices (bills) for all the purchases made in the period, so that figure is also known. Adding beginning inventory and purchases together , we get the total amount of goods that were available for sale during the period. If we subtract the ending inventory from the goods available number , we get the “cost of goods sold ,”which will be noted on the Income Statement. How do we know what the dollar value of the ending inventory is if we are not using a specific identification- type inventory accounting system? When the inventory manager conducts a monthly , or periodic, physical audit, s/hecounts inventory units and not dollars. How does the accountant translate units into dollars for valuing the end- ing inventory ?67 Kenneth S.Bigel 67\\n\\nNote : COGS include raw materials, freight-in, electricity , and may also include “imputable” labor and depreciation. Do not look at the container , but at what is inside. – Famous Hebrew saying Don’ t judge a book by its cover . – Another famous sayingIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 68\\n\\n3.8 Units to Numbers: FIFO and LIFO If most businesses “do” inventory periodically (rather than perpetually )for practical reasons, by quite liter- ally,physically counting (ending) inventory units , usually monthly , how does the accountant translate the ending inventory units counted into dollars? As we shall see below , management and its accountants have ample dis- cretion regarding choice of inventory costing method. In the following illustration for the two most popular cost- ing methods , the company has started the year with oneunit of inventory carried at a cost of $100. Y ou will note that the costs go up in time, reflecting an inflationary environment. It is also assumed that only one identical inventory item is being counted. Alternate Solutions to the Ending Inventory Pr oblem In the chart below , you will find alternate solutions to the Ending Inventory Problem when the accountant employs either of two popular costing methods: FIFO (First In, First Out) and LIFO (Last In, First Out). A detailed step-by-step explanation of the chart is found on the next page. Before flipping to the next page, see if you are able to decipher69 Kenneth S.Bigel 69\\n\\nthe table on your own. Immediately following the table is a discussion of the dif fering results of the two methods. You will note that the choice of method materially af fects the Cost of Goods Sold and Ending Inventory values, and therefore all the other values in the table as well. Clearly , a firm will adopt LIFO if it wishes to reduce inflated, “windfall ”profits ,andhence taxes ,in an infla- tionary environment. LIFO will consequently reduce inventory assets on the balance sheet and make relevant ratios ,and hence loan prospects ,possibly less attractive to banks who wish to see more assets against which loans may be made and, possibly , secured. Management and its accountants have to weigh the of fsetting considera- tions ofone or the other costing method. Take note that inventory is part of current assets and “working capital” (WC). WC = Current Assets less Current Liabilities.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 70\\n\\n3.9 In ventory Costing Calculations: A Closer L ook at the COGS and Ending Inventory Computations First, it must be recognized that the sales amount is inde- pendent of any costing method. For every sale, there is an invoice, and the dollar amount is not at all subject to any choice of accounting inventory costing method. Under FIFO, the first- in were assumed to be the first- out. So, the cost of goods sold (COGS) figure was the sum of the first four (since four units were sold) costs: $100 + 150 + 200 + 250 = $700. The income statement will show a $700 COGS number as a deduction from sales to arrive at the gross profit of $2,000 –700 = $1,300. This left $300 in the ending inventory on the balance sheet. Notice that $700 + 300 = $1,000 or the entire inventory cost. Under LIFO, we must take the last-in ,first-out order to compute the sum of the units sold and to arrive at the COGS number . Therefore, we add in reverse chronological order: $300 + 250 + 200 + 150 = $900. The ending inven- tory will be the first unit acquired, costing $100. Again, the two numbers add up to the sum of the inventory cost: $100 + 900 = $1,000. Gross profits will be lower: $2,000 – 900 = $1,100. T axes are based on profits. In an inflationary environment, taxes payable will therefore be lower . Assuming inventory costs rise as often happens when there is inflation , FIFO will always produce a higher gross profit.71 Kenneth S.Bigel 71\\n\\nWhen corporations expect high inflation (as occurred in the 1970s and in the early 2020s), many will switch to LIFO in order to reduce taxes. Companies pay higher taxes when profits are higher , as might be the case using FIFO , assum- ing all else equal .To switch to LIFO, the firm must com- plete IRSForm 970 . The corporation cannot go back and forth from one method to the other as the wind blows. Y ou will find the form on the Internet. The company will prefer LIFO to reduce taxes. It will pre- fer FIFO to report higher inventory levels and thus show “more” assets to lenders and shareholders. W ell, which of the two is preferable in the end? It is permissible for the company to maintain two sets of books, one for filing taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) and the other for “reporting.” Moreover , it can use varying methods for dif- ferent inventory items – FIFO for this and LIFO for that. How do you like that?! Once again, a company may use one inventory costing method for one inventory item, and a dif ferent method for another item. In the end, the various items will be lumped together on one inventory line on the Balance Sheet and reflected as such in COGS . There might be a footnote indicating that inventory was valued using both FIFO and LIFO (and perhaps still another method), but further details may be absent. T alk about confusing!Introduction toFinancial Analysis 72\\n\\nKey Terms:3.10 In ventory Accounting Issues: LIFO Of course, the previous example was “loaded” in that pur- chase costs rose dramatically over time . In reality , prices tend often to rise with inflation, so the direction of the results in actuality would notbeaffected .If,in fact ,costs declined over the considered periods, the direction of the results would be exactly reversed, and your choice of method, if you anticipated this alternate outcome, would be dif ferent accordingly .Here are some relevant upcoming questions. 1.What is meant by “LIFO Base”? 2.What is the ef fect of costing units sold from the base? 3.There is a technical problem in connection with interim reporting under LIFO (in FIFO too). Using the foregoing example, imagine that the firm –indef- initely into the future –regularly purchased four units and sold four units. Imagine also that there continued to be some inflation. A firm cannot accurately provide its LIFO inventory figure until it closes the books on the period. More specifically , the firm cannot figure the Cost of Goods Sold, and therefore its LIFO inventory until it has, quite literally , made the last73 Kenneth S.Bigel 73\\n\\nLIFO baseinventory purchase and thus knows the costs ofunits acquired. It would be conceivable that after some time, inventory costs and sales prices would be quite high, say $20 per unit – theoretically . Still, that one very “old” unit, which is being carried at ahistorical (ancient!) cost, would reflect a very low “cost basis” of, say $1, representing the inventory’ s LIFO Base . (See the example on the next page.) If many years later ,the firm suddenly then sold five units, it would dig into or “cost out” its LIFO base and reflect a very high profit for that item. This now high profit on that unit would be contrary to the firm’ s motivation for adopting LIFO in the first place, which is to minimize profits and conse- quent lyitstax liabilities. By example, let’ s say the firm is on a calendar year fiscal cycle. It cannot know in the interim, say , in Novem- ber,what the December year-end inventory shall be. In our earlier case, the fourth unit purchased is the firstout andfirstcharged to COGS. The third acquired is the sec- ond to go,etc. W e count backwards starting with the last one in! We cannot know what the last one’ s cost is – until the last one isin!(True, this problem pertains to FIFO, but is less worrisome analytically .) An illustration of this prob- lem follows on the next page. Note : You should be aware that Cost of Goods Sold represents the cost of inventory , which passes through the income state-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 74\\n\\nment when sales are recognized, and includes raw materi- als, “imputable” labor and depreciation, freight-in, and pos- sibly more. “Imputable” refers to measurable costs that can – with certainty – be related to production, in addition to the otherwise explicit inventory costs. Suppose you have a widget making machine, which costs $1,000,000 and the manufacturer warrants that it has an expected life of producing one million units, after which it must be scrapped. Under this circumstance, the cost accountant may impute $1 of depreciation to each unit of inventory . Otherwise, depreciation would be shown separately , i.e., lower down on the income statement, as illustrated in the sample income statement earlier .75 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n3.11 LIFO Base Illustr ation XYZ Corp. costs its inventory on a LIFO basis due to the cost and price inflation its product continuously manifests. In the first year illustrated, let’ s call it “20X1,” the com- pany purchased 5 units. It sold 4 units, leaving the oldest unit to be carried forward as the LIFO Base Inventory to the next year , “20×2.” See the table below . Each year going forward, it continues to purchase 4 units and sell 4 units. Therefore, the LIFO Base, initially costed at $1, carries over until “20×5.” The revenue the company receives equals the average of the last price in the current and prior years. The last price, i.e., the price at which the last unit was sold, in “20X0” was $2. Due to the high LIFO costing method, the gross profits remain low , thereby min- imizing taxes. Had it done its inventory on a FIFO basis, its gross profits would have been slightly higher . (You can figure this out.) In the year , 20×5, the company sells all 5 units that were available for sale. The last unit sold was at a price of $22 and its cost, based on LIFO, was only $1. The company would therefore book a high, “windfall” profit on that unit, contrary to the intent of LIFO, which is to keep (taxable) profits low .Introduction toFinancial Analysis 76 76\\n\\nThe purpose of using LIFO Inventory Accounting is to reduce gross profits and thus taxes. W e have seen that sell- ing product from the LIFO Base will negate this objective. To avoid this problem, management should order a 6th unit in 20×5 so that the LIFO Base is not costed out. In doing so, management is “manipulating” the ef fect of its inven- tory costing method. Remember , this is accounting fiction in the sense that the costs are unrelated to the actual age of the units. A good merchandiser would have long ago moved out any product that is subject to physical aging.77 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n3.12 Accounting for L ong-term Assets: Straight-Line Depreciation (F or Reporting Purposes Only) The following pages represent three deprecia- tion- costingmethod alternatives for plant (i.e., buildings) or equipment , which are acceptable for reporting pur- poses (only) .Remember that “property ,” i.e., land, is notdepreciated. There is an entirely dif ferent set of meth- ods required for tax accounting , which we shall not cover herewith .The following methods are unacceptable for T ax accounting. The first method we shall outline iscalled “straight line.” Under this method, we expense on the income statement the same amount of depreciation each year . If, for instance, the asset is estimated to have a five-year life, as in this example, we shall depreciate 1/5 or 20% of the asset yearly. This ratio will be applied against (i.e., multiplied by) the dif ference between the property’ shistorical cost and its estimated salvage value. (Note the key word: “esti- mated ,”which is used here for thesecond time. ) Herein we shall refer to this dif ference in the two numbers as the “depreciable amount,” a phrase, which we use here , butwhich you shall not find popularly used elsewhere. Let’s assume the following:Introduction toFinancial Analysis 78 78\\n\\nAs you read this and the next two examples, remember that “Salvage V alue” does not apply to buildings but only to equipment. Also remember that property , i.e., land, cannot be depreciated. In “year zero,” which means “now” (see table below), the asset shall be carried on the balance sheet at its original, historical cost of $1,500,000. Each subsequent year , we shall depreciate 1/5, or 20% of the dif ference between the cost and the salvage value, this dif ference being: $1,500,000 – $500,000 = $1,000,000. Thus, the deprecia- tion expense is: $1,000,000 ÷ 5 = $200,000 each year . As the asset balance is depreciated on the balance sheet and the depreciation is expensed on the income statement, the carrying balance of the asset is reduced by $200,000 each year , until – after five years in this case – the build- ing or equipment is sold for its estimated salvage value. Should the asset be sold for more or less than its salvage value, the accountant will record an “unusual” or “non- recurring” profit or l oss accordingly . 79 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n3.13 Accounting Entries for Depreciation The following represents the accounting book entries for straight-line depreciation in the second year (from the prior page) , by way of example . (000) Income Statement Book Entry Depreciation Expense ( dr) $200 Balance Sheet Book Entries (End of second Y ear) Note above that the debits are indented to the left, and the credits are more to the right. That’ s as it should be. Balance Sheet Appearance The balance sheet ,at the end of the second year ,will con- tain the following items: You will recall that equities are credit balance accounts. As noted earlier , you should think of the income statement asIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 80 80\\n\\npart of the equity section of the balance sheet. This is not a stretch as retained earnings are derived from the income statement, i.e., when the“addition to retained earnings ”are transferred to the balance sheet – at year ’s end, at the time thatthe books are cl osed.Therefore , think of revenues as credits ,and expenses as debits. A wise man’ s questions contain half the answer . -Solomon ibn Gabirol81 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n3.14 Acceler ated Depreciation Methods: Sum-of-the- Years' Digits (F or reporting purposes only) There are two more methods, which we shall examine, both of which may be referred to as “accelerated ”depreci- ation methods because in the early years there will be more depreciation expense than in the la ter years. You’ll remember that the ratio we used in the given exam- ple for St raight Line was 20% .Under “Sum-of-the-years’ digits” (SOYD), we apply a new ratio against the $1,000,000 depreciable amount. In the denominator for the SOYD ratio, we calculate the sum of the year s’digits, which ,in this five-year exam- pleis: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15. In the numerator , we use the reverse order of the years ,starting with five,andthen go ing backwards each year. So, in year one, we expense 5/15 of $1,000,000 = $333,333, and reduce the balance accordingly .In the sec- ond year the ratio is 4/15. In the third, year the ratio is 3/15, or, as it happens, the same 20% that we used in the straight- linemethod; you’ll note that the depreciation expense after thisthird year will be less than under straight-line. At this rate, you will note that after five years we will have depre- ciated 15/15 or 100% of the depreciable amount.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 82 82\\n\\n83 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n3.15 Acceler ated Depreciation Methods: Double/Declining Balance (For reporting purposes only) Under Double /Declining Balance (D/DB), we combine two concepts, hence the slash in the name. That’ s the way to remember what this method is about. First of all , we depreciate at double the straight-line rate, which in this case, would be 2 × 2 0%,or 40% per year . If we do this doubling of the annual rate, we would have depreciated the entire asset in half the asset’ sesti- mated life, rather than in the full five years; or alternatively , we would have depreciated twice the asset’ s original costover the entire five years. Either alternative is clearly incorrect and una cceptable . Instead, we depreciate twice the straight-line rate, not against the depreciable amount, but against the declining balance , ignoring salvage value. That’ s the second con- cept: the use of a declining balance. So, in the first year , we depreciate 40% of $1,500,000 ,or $600,000, leaving a new balance of $900,000. In the second year , we depre- ciate 40% of the declining balance of $900,000, which is $360,000. In this example (and not necessarily in all examples), if we continue to depreciate at this rate, we will go below the salvage value in the third year . At this point ,the account antwill either depreciate the balance of $40,000 inIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 84 84\\n\\none-fell s woop, or , more likely , straight- line the $40,000 balance over the remaining three years. (S/he could also adjust the salvage value lower .)In straight-lining the $40,000 remaining balance, rather than deducting $40,000, one may deduct $13,333 ($40,000 ÷ 3) for each of the last three years. D/DB is even more accelerated than SOYD, as you may have already noticed. The depreciation expense is greater in the early years . Your income statement and balance sheet will reflect the following: 85 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n3.16 Compar ativ e Summary of Depreciation Methods Given : Straight Line : Accelerated Depreciation Methods : •Sum-of-the- Years’Digits : •Double/Declining Balance :Introduction toFinancial Analysis 86 86\\n\\nAgain, D/DB is the most accelerated of the various meth- ods. The finance student needs to have some sense of the“distortions” that accounting data present to him as a result of (management and the accountants’) “choice ,”and its impact on financial analysis .In addition to the alter- nate depreciation method spresent edin this example, we may also note that the salvage value is a nestimate.

Analysts rely mightily on accounting data. Thus, we must know what is going on in the corporate accounting world. Reported earnings are subject to all kindsof accounting chicanery , and it is earnings that largely drive stock prices ! Thus, firms have an incentive to “manage earnings” in order to guide analysts’ earnings expectations downward and, thereby , report actual earnings that were greater than analysts’ previous consensus expectations. Corpora- tions cannot legally inform analysts what their exact earn- ings expectations are, so they emplo y various mechanisms to guide the analysts. Stock prices, in the wake of this management, will react 1.This section is based on Li, S., & Moore, E.A. (201 1).

Such stocks will provide higher returns than those of firms who do not beat expectations,2 as investors may believe that beating expectations signals positive trends in future earnings. Stocks of corporations that miss expected earnings are penalized asymmetrically; markets penalize stocks more for missed earnings than they reward companies for positive surprises.3 Not all potentially misleading accounting data are inten- tionally “managed” by the firm and its accountants. In some cases, GAAP accounting provides no discretionary opportunities for earnings management ,e.g., the choice of either FIFO or LIFO, yet the data may nonetheless not rep- resent true values . An example that we discussed had to do with historical bias. In this case, there is only one way in which a long-term asset can be “booked, ”and hence its reported asset and tax depreciation figures are based on that historical cost. The historical record is unlikely to be realistic. Beyond these examples, inventory can be written down on a discretionary basis within reasonable limits. Reported esti- mates and reserves can be manipulated within reasonable parameters. Indeed, reserves are fertile ground for manipula- tion. In order to manage earnings upward, the firm may choose to “under -reserve” 2.Bartov E., D. Givoly and C. Hayn. 2002. The rewards to meeting or beating earnings expectations.

As noted, managed manipulation of accrual accounting methods will lead to varying presentations of the same economic phe- nomena. AEM, thus, involves the use of the accounting system itself in order toinfluence a desired result.On the other hand, we have also provided some illus- trations of Accrual Earnings Manage- ment (AEM ) in the manner of Inventory Costing andReported Depreciation Accounting Methods (as opposed to tax depreciation methods). AEM has to do with GAAP -permitted choices. Timing the sale of inventory in order to boost earnings in a tar geted period. Another opportunity for earnings man- agement comes from Real Earnings Management (REM ).In this case, a firm may engage in certain actual transac- tions in order to accomplish a particular accounting outcome. Specifically , the firm could structure transactions by set- ting them at varying discretionary points in time (“timing”) in order to achieve a pre-set accounting result. Here are some examples of REM: 1.Delaying fixed asset maintenance expenses. 2.Delaying operating expenses, including adver- tising and R&D. 3.Putting of f salary increases and the payment of bonuses.99 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nPublic Expecta- tions Man- agement Fraud4.Delaying taking on potentially profitable capital investment projects. And… guess what? They can do this time and again, over and over . One must be suspicious of what a CEO says on televi- sion. Auditors cannot control or influence this phenomenon as financial statements are not involved! W e will let you decide ifAEM, REM, and P EMlegitimately cir- cumvent accounting rules or not, and whether you may consider it s use ethical – or not! Third, firms have a nincentive to manage the public’ s future earn- ings expectations in such manner as ana- lysts and investors expect less and get more in earnings in reality than had been expected. That is not to say that all companies, at all times , will manage earnings expectations downward. By communicating press releases, meeting with analysts, and giving TV interviews, a firm can engage in Public Expectations Manage- ment (PEM) .Of course, such manipulations, if that is the correct phrase here, are not af fected by the accountant. Still a final manipulation of earnings may come from fraudulent accounting practices. In sum, firms can employ any and all of the following four means of accounting chi- canery: 1.Accrual Earnings Management ; 2.Real Earnings Management ; 3. Pub- licExpectations Management ; 4.Accounting Fraud . Don’ tforget:fraud isillegal !Introduction toFinancial Analysis 100\\n\\nNote: This discussion was based on a published paper , which may be found at the following link. •Read the accounting statements’ foot- notes; alsoread “Management’ s Discussion and Analysis”! •Quality financial statements have repeatable earnings and are not prone to reserves manage- ment or any form of AEM; over the long-term, accounting and cash earnings should be approx- imately the same.101 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n4.4 Business Ethics: Examples of Fraudulent Re venue Recognition Business Ethics: Examples of F raudulent Re venue Recognition1 Below are some more dif ficulties that you should be aware of.Thesehave more to do with accounting fraud than the legitimate accounting choices enumerated earlier . Channel Stuf fing – Companies sell lar ge amounts of goods to distributors in order to book lar ge profits. Under SEC accounting, it is permissible to book sales for shipped product, less a reasonable allowance for returns. However ,channel stuffers may not be able to make reason- able estimates and would therefore be required to defer rev- enue recognition until return estimates may be projected. This may result in deferring revenue for months. Stuffing occurs when vendors ship merchandise in advance of scheduled shipment dates without buyers’ acquiescence. Bill and Hold – Revenue is booked even though the prod- uct may not have been shipped and payment may not actu- ally be due for a long period. For example, Sunbeam sold 1.The following section was derived from a report in the New Y ork T imes on December 4, 1999, p. C4.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 102 102\\n\\ncharcoal grills in the winter , although they were not to be shipped until springtime; after a change in management , books were restated to eliminate the relevant revenue and profit. This arrangement would be allowed, under SEC accounting, provided the buyer requested it; the buyer must also have a good business reason for the request. Further , the goods must be either already assem- bled or otherwise ready for shipment before revenue is rec- ognized. Internet Sales – If an internet site is acting as agent for , as an example, an airline ticket sale, it may only book the revenue it earns. This revenue may be only a commission rather than the full value of the ticket. If it acts as princi- pal,it may book the lar ger amount as revenue and another amount as expense (the portion which it must return to the airline), showing the net result – which would, in ef fect, be the commission. Internet companies whose stock prices are sensitive to “top-line ”growth prefer to recognize sales as principals. Principal transactions are permitted by the SEC provided the company took title to the product before ship- ment and “has the risks andrewards of ownership, such as the risk of loss for collection, delivery , or returns…”. Discussion Question : What are the moral and legal dif fer- ences between “fraud” and the creative use of accounting methods and assumptions?103 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nLying speech is an abomination to God, but those who act faithfully please Him. – Proverbs 12:22Introduction toFinancial Analysis 104\\n\\n4.5 Business Ethics: Examples of Fraudulent Expense Recognition Business Ethics: Examples of F raudulent Expense Recognition1 Interpretive accounting issues are clearly not limited to the revenue side. Here are some further issues in connection with expenses. The analyst must always be on the alert. Stock options provided to executives are not accounted for as expenses, thereby giving earnings a boost because there is no associated expensing to salary . According to a study by Ms. Pat McConnell of Bear Stearns, in 1999 net income of the S & P would have been 6% lower had employee stock options been reflected as an expense. Options will be exercised at below the market’ s stock prices resulting in an associated cost to the firm. In 1998 and 1997 the reductions would have been 4% and 3% respectively . The F ASB requires that companies include in their foot- notes the ef fect of options granted after 12/15/94. The full effect of this was first felt in 1999 as many companies’ plans allow options to vest in five years or less. If compa- 1.The following was derived from a report in the New Y ork T imes on August 29, 2000, p. C1.105 Kenneth S.Bigel 105\\n\\nnies choose not to disclose options as a compensation expense (and the F ASB does not require this), the disclo- sure must be made as a footnote reflecting the adjusted net income and EPS had the cost of options been charged. Obviously , most companies chose the latter . Ms. McConnell found only Boeing and W inn-Dixie, i.e., just two of the 500 S & P companies, that chose to report options as an expense. Earnings at 21 companies fell by more than half, if options were expensed; this list includes McDermott International, Y ahoo, Autodesk, and Polaroid. Twelve of these companies would have reported a loss, including Micron T echnology . She further cites the fol- lowing declines in earnings due to options: Health Care Services companies-38% Computer Networking companies-24% Commercial and Consumer services-21% Communication Equipment makers-19% Overall, the S & P 500growth rate in earnings would decrease from 1 1% to 9% over the last three years – if options were expensed.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 106\\n\\n4.6 Chapter 4: Re view Questions Chapter 4: Review Questions 1.What are some of the critical dif ferences between Accounting and Finance? 2.In what ways can Accounting d ata be “man- aged”? 3.What are the critical dif ferences between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement? 4.Identify the correct choices : Assets aredr/crbalance accounts while Liabilities and Equity are dr/crbalance accounts. 5.How are the Additions to Retained Earn- ings and Retained Earnings dif ferent from one another ? 6.Who takes the most risk in order to earn the highest return? 7.Give an example where it is permissible to use different accounting methods for reporting ver- sus tax accounting . 8.What are some problems pursuant to using LIFO-based accounting? 9.True or False: Operating Profits include interest107 Kenneth S.Bigel 107\\n\\npaid. 10.

Keep in mind that the purpose of releasing Financial Statements is to enable effective credit and investment decisions, i.e., decisions regarding the future prospects of a business entity . Potential and current lenders wish to assess the creditabil- ityof the firm and shareholders wish to assess thereturn stheir investments will earn. W ill the borrowing corporation be able to make timely interest payments on its debt? W ill shareholders receive suf ficient dividends and growth in their capital investments, i.e., increases in share prices, to justify owning a portion of this corporation after considering the risk sinvolved? A goodpredictor of stock price performance may be book value – assets less liabilities, and earnings. A recent study1 has found that the usefulness of these predictor vari- ables has become attenuated in recent years, more particu- larly since the crisis of 2000-2001. A more useful predictor is cash flow . Cash flows are easier to predict than earnings and book values and have greater impact on price than the others. Yet, regulators and the accounting profession continue pro- ducing rulings that make reading statements more com- 1.SeeThe End of Accounting , by Baruch Lev and Feng Gu (W iley, 2016)113 Kenneth S.Bigel 113\\n\\nplex andtherefore opaque. Accrual accounting, despite its flagrant flaws, has become a faith ,rather than a sci- ence,that suf ficiently describes a certain reality . Does one really need to pore through two hundred pages of arcane financial statement information in order to make an invest- ment decision? Isn’ t the purpose of a statement to simplify and clarify the financial condition and productivity of the corporation and its management? Much has changed in recent decades. W e now live in a much more technological world. Communications are faster . Investment analysis and its implementation are speedier . When we look at financial statements, little, if anything, has changed for the last one hundred years. State- ments look the same; the accounts are the same. Double- entry bookkeeping has not advanced since it was developed inItaly by Luca Pacioli in 1494! Intangibles, including brand names, patents, customer lists, R&D-in- process, training, and information systems, are not carried on the balance sheet, but usually expensed only as incurred. More and more, investment decisions are made using data outside of the accounting sphere. Clearly , accounting reporting methods need updating2 . 2.There were two more crises; the Banking Crisis of 2007-2008, and the COVID-19 outbreak (2020) which led to a market crash, which was NOT due to any financial causes.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 114\\n\\nOn Achie vement The secr et to getting ahead …is getting started. -Mark T wain The secr et of achievement is to hold a pictur e of a successful outcome in the mind. –Henry David Thoreau Ninety-nine per cent of the failur es come fr om peo- ple… who ar e in the habit of making excuses. -Geor ge W ashington Carver Scientist and Inventor115 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nSuccess is the ability to go fr om failur e to failur e without losing your enthusiasm. –Winston ChurchillIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 116\\n\\n5.3 Financial Ratios Ratio analysis is fundamental to finance, and ratios are regularly used in this discipline. Ratios are basic tools of analysis. It is very important, therefore, that you master the following. It is important to understand that ratios do not pr ovide answers, but instead raise questions , which t he analyst must then resolve. Questions raised must be investi- gated. Analyst speculations should be based on knowledge of financial statements, the macroeconomic and industry backgrounds in which the company operates, management profiles, and company history .Theratios themselves are derived from accounting data, which are subject to inter- pretive issues. A ratio consists of two numbers, which are compared to one another . “2:1” (two-to-one )or “1:3” are ratios. Infact, anysimple number is a ratio because it can always be compared to one! Fractional numbers also pertain. W e may also think of ratios as consisting of a numerator (on the top) and a denominator (on the bottom) , e.g., 2/1 and 1/3 above. No (financial) ratio means anything by itself – it must be compared to some other datum in order to derive infer- ences. The means by which the comparison may be made are: Longitudinal (Vertical) :This would involve comparing a117 Kenneth S.Bigel 117\\n\\nratio for a company at two dif ferent points in time. For instance, we may say that IBM ’s profit mar gin last year was 10% versus this year ’s 20%. What are the rele- vant trends?Longitudinal analysis data can be ef fectively diagrammed. Cross-Sectional (Horizontal) : here we would compare two companies on the basis of a selected ratio at the same point in time. This might lead us to conclude, for instance, that one company is more profitable than another at pre- sent. At times, the construction of a financial ratio may involve comparing a Balance Sheet datum with an Income State- ment number . This presents a problem in that the former statement is a static, or “as-of” based statement, whereas the latter is a flow ,or moving picture. In order to compare apples to apples, i.e.,when comparing an Income State- ment with a Balance Sheet number ,the analyst may choose touse an average number for the Bal- ance Sheet datum in order to make the Balance Sheet num- ber appear more like a “flow .”The average may be calculated in various ways, e.g., by averaging two con- secutive year -end data, using quarterlies, or , if available, monthlies. Averaging may be especially warranted in cases where balance sheet data fluctuate widely due to seasonality or other factors. For example, a snow-mobile manufacturer may have much inventory in September and far less inven- tory in March. In such a case, it may be advised for the analyst to average the inventory number over , say , four quarters. In the pages to follow , we will learn how this averaging is actually done by the analyst – and under what circumstances.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 118\\n\\nBelow are some important financial ratios, listed by cat- egory . When would you utilize certain ratios? How may your choice of ratio vary from sector to sector (or industry to industry)? In many , if not most, instances there is no universal – minimum, maximum or average – “ideal” ratio that relates to all situations. The ideal ratio, if there is such a thing, is a function of numerous variables, including the nature of the industry , the company , the management risk profile, and perhaps the shareholders ’risk profiles and goals as well. As we go through the discussion regarding Ratio Analysis, some of you may wish to calculate the generic ratios pro- vided using an example. At the end of Chapter Seven, the reader will find a page entitled “Simple Ratio Analysis Exercise.” That page contains a Balance Sheet and Income Statement for a fictitious company; a ratios worksheet fol- lows on the subsequent page, with the solutions following that page. Y ou may work through the ratios there. Keep in mind that the actual ratios’ arithmetic calculations are secondary to the primary and underlying understanding of what the actual ratios are in the abstract, and what they mean. Once you understand the ratios themselves, e.g., what it means when we say that “average collections are 32 days,” or that the TIE Ratio should exceed one, the calcu- lations become a matter of a simple arithmetic exercise, a mere changing of the inputted numbers to fixed formulae. That said, you will find a comprehensive exercise, includ- ing a Balance Sheet and Income Statement, requiring the calculation of all our Financial Ratios below – in Section #7.5. As you calculate, don’ t forget the numerous faults with accounting data!119 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n5.4 L ongitudinal vs. Cross-sectional Analysis (Example ) Definitions : ◦Longitudinal : ▪Different times ▪Over time ▪Same company ◦Cross-sectional : ▪Same time ▪Different companies ▪Company-to-com- pany In all instances the ratios presented will be the same.

Y ou will find that the example is constituted by a fictitious company’ s Balance Sheet and Income Statement. We are going to list 20 ratios – covering six categories –in this section. After this discussion, an exercise in calculat- ing all the ratios is presented so that you may apply what you learned . The first category is liquidity ratios. The idea of liquidity has to do with the ease and speed with which an asset may be converted into cash – without compromising its “true” worth or “intrinsic value.” It must satisfy both conditions in order to be considered liquid. For instance, it is possible to sell virtually anything at a“fire–sale price, ”if one needs the cash. The question is whether an item worth, say $100, will fetch $100 – or less. If less, we may say that the item is not liquid, as the seller123 Kenneth S.Bigel 123\\n\\ndid not obtain its true worth, even though s/he was able to obtain some cash for it. An example of a liquid asset would be IBM stock. Let’ s say it is trading for $ 190. Should one wish to sell 1 00 shares of the stock, s/he would obtain approximately $19,000 for it. However , if I wanted to sell my tie, for which I paid $50, it may be dif ficult for me to get that amount. Whether you wish to consider the asset’ s“value ”a matter of its original cost or its “current value,” is a matter ofanalytic choice and context . The notion of liquidity is closely tied to another notion: “marketability .” This has to do with the availability of a market in which purchases and sales may be readily trans- acted. For instance, the stock market provides IBM com- mon shares with a great deal of marketability . Should I however wish to sell my tie, I would not know where to go to find a “used- tiemarket.” Real estate markets are domi- nated by brokers who advertise frequently , and I may easily sell my car to a used car dealer . In the case of your typical corporation, it will not own other companies’ stock. It will instead produce goods and services for sale and profit. Thus, it will regularly carry inventory and accounts receivable, which are reported as “current assets.” The net current assets (current assets less current liabilities), being short-term, are presumably liquid. If the assets are liquid, the firm will be able to quickly con- vert the assets into cash, which will be used to honor its current liabilities due. If not liquid, the firm will have dif- ficulty paying its current liabilities; it will be said to have a “liquidity problem.” Now that we know what is meant by liquidity and weIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 124\\n\\nunderstand that the liquidity notion applies to “net current assets,” let’ s quantify the notion by detailing some relevant ratios that put numbers to the idea. The greater the mea- surable liquidity the less the riskthat the firm will not have sufficient funds to defray its short-term payment require- ments. Curr ent Ratio = Curr ent Asset sDivided by Curr ent Liabilities = CA ÷ CL The current ratio gauges the extent to which a corporation has the liquidity with which it may honor its short-term obligations or liabilities. Does it have the cash to pay its suppliers when accounts payable are due? Are inventories and accounts receivable sufficient (and liquid) to cover its current liabilities? W e will assume, for now that the inven- tory and accounts receivable are completely liquid. It stands to reason that a watermark level for this ratio should be 1:1 or 1x (“one times”) ; one would not want to see this ratio go below that figure as it would imply that the company does not have sufficient current assets and , hence, the liquidity to meet its current obligations. Many analysts agree that 1.5x or 2x are reasonable figures, but we should beleery of such arbitrary minima. Companies that are very ef ficient in the manner in which they manage their current assets may have current ratios close to 1. In general, ratios will vary from industry to industry . Note that this ratio is af fected by the choice of inventory costing method (e.g., FIFO vs. LIFO) because inventory is a con- stituent of current assets .125 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nNote: Working Capital = Current Assets less Current Lia- bilities. If the current ratio is less than one, the working capital will be negative. (See Ratio Exercise.) Quick Ratio (“Acid T est”) = (CA – Inv entory)÷CL Some analysts take a more conservative approach in the assessment of liquidity coverage by assuming that inven- tory is worthless (even though it may , in fact, not be – or not be entirely) and hence that current liabilities will be covered by all current assets except inventory . Indeed, in some industries inventory quickly becomes obsolete due to technological advances ; in other cases, inventory may be easily damaged, or lose its fashion and sales appeal.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 126\\n\\nThe current and quick ratios may be thought of as “cover- age” ratios in that they indicate the extent to which liquid assets are adequate to “cover ,” or pay of f, current liabil- ities, especially accounts payable and notes payable (i.e., short-term loans). Average Collection Period ( ACP ) =Days sales out- standing (DSO) = (A/R ÷Credit Sales) (360) “A/R” stands for Accounts Receivable. This ratio tells the analyst approximately how long it takes the firm to collect its receivables; the ratio is expressed in days. The shorter the collection period, the more liquid the firm’ s accounts receivable. Note that we use credit sales because only credit (and not cash) sales become accounts receivable. This ACP figure may then be compared to the firm’ s typical credit terms. If, for ar gument’ s sake, the ACP exceeds the firm’ s credit terms, which may be 30 days, the analyst may first assess whether the firm is having collection problems. Alterna- tively , the analyst may investigate whether the firm is act- ing aggressively in its marketing, and choosing to live with the consequences of some late payments as a result. Perhaps the firm expects that the incremental profits will exceed any losses in its collections. This ratio is our first case, so far , of “apples and oranges” in that, here, we note that both income statement and bal- ance sheet number s appear within the same ratio. This inconsistency needs to be fixed ; we ought not to com- bine one datum from the Balance Sheet , which is asta- ticfigure , with an other from the Income Statement , which is aflow kind of number ,within one ratio . The two areinconsistent with each other .127 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nIn such cases as this, what the analyst may choose to do is “average” the balance sheet number . One way of doing this would be by taking this year ’s and last year ’s year - end numbers and averaging them(i.e., add the two numbers up and divide by two). W e could also use quarterlies or , if available, monthlies. In businesses where receivables fluc- tuate over the course of the year and may thus be either rel- atively high or low at certain times of year or during certain seasons, it may be better to average the quarterly numbers, if possible. This technique would then capture a better sense of move- ment over the course of the seasonal business cycle and would thus provide a better comparison with the income statement number , which , again, flow over the course of theentire year .If the balance sheet number does not fluc- tuate – much, or at all – over time, there may be no need for averaging. This choice is at the discretion of the ana- lyst. Compare Companies “A” and “B” in terms of their accounts receivable or inventory levels , as it were, over the course of four quarters. Is anything accom- plished by averaging theBalance Sheet numbers for Com- pany A? You will alsonote that (usually) Accounts Receivable willdisplay a smaller number than Sales . Normally , we would expect that accounts receivable are collected more or less monthly ;indeed, ifsales terms are 30 days, weIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 128\\n\\nshould get about 12 collections per year .This is illustrated on the next page. We shall also assume a 360-day year ,consisting of twelve 30-day rolling months ,because most often collections are demanded within 30 days . Some analysts will use a 365-day year on the rationale that Credit Sales accumu- lateover a365-day calendar year .It’s your choice, Ms/r. Analyst! Final note: If you are analyzing data for just one quar- ter,you should use 90, rather than 360, as the multiplier for theACP .For two or three quarters, you will use 180 and 270respectively . Inventory T urnover = COGS ÷Inventory This ratio tells us how often the inventory “turns over ,” that is to say , how often the inventory – in its entirety – is replaced. Would you buy fresh tomatoes from a company whose inventory turnover is 10x a year (or every 36 days)? Note that this ratio is af fected by the choice of inventory costing method. This ratio has some issues with mixing Balance Sheet and Income Statement numbers, which was discussed the prior section concerning ACP .129 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n5.6 The Income Statement v ersus the Balance Sheet It is important to understand how related Balance Sheet and Income Statement numbers may compare with one another , especially when used in a particular ratio. For instance, in the A verage Collection Period, we compare MONTHL Y credit sales (from the Income Statement) to MONTHL Y accounts receivable (from the Balance Sheet). Which number is bigger? T ake note that the quarterly data for the Credit Sales are cumulative as reported by the accountant. W e are also assuming that the receivables are collected in full at each month’ s end. Let’ s see.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 130 130\\n\\nIn the table above, we show credit sales on a monthly basis for the “Fictitious Company” over the course of the fis- cal year ended (FYE) 12.31.20XX. W e are assuming that credit terms are 30 days and that all receivables are col- lected on time. Which number is greater – the credit sales or the accounts receivable? Clearly , after February , Credit Sales, which are cumulative, will exceed accounts receivable. A similar analysis may beapplied to the inventory turnover ratio.131 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n5.7 Accounts Receivable Aging Schedule An aging schedule is an internal, managerial, and confi- dential document, which shows, account by account, how much money is due the seller from the time of sale, and whether a customer account is “current” or is “pa st due.” It is a necessary management tool. The schedule would provide the external analyst with much more than s/he may otherwise know by alternatively cal- culating Days Sales Outstanding. It is much more detailed. Unfortunately , the schedule is an internal management doc- ument and unavailable to outsiders. The customer accounts are listed row by row , either by name or some some other identifier . Since most credit sales require payment within 30 days, the first column shows how much money is due where the sale occurred less than 30 in the past. As you read to the right, you will see uncol- lected credit sales figures that are more than 30, 60, and 90 days old, and the respective amounts due. Thus, the sched- ule might look somewhat like t hefollowing. In examining the schedule, what might you tentatively conclude about each of the five listed accounts?Introduction toFinancial Analysis 132 132\\n\\nBy examining this schedule, the analyst may uncover some interesting findings. For instance: 1.ACP/ DSO may be higher than the company’ s sales terms due, possibly , to one very lar ge account skewing the average. It may also be greater due to the company’ s decision to enter a new geographical or product market, knowing in advance that such entry will slow down its col- lections, but expecting that the added profits will make the expansion worthwhile. 2.The analyst may see how many accounts are current and how many should be written of f– analytically – by the analyst. (Remember: this is not accounting, so a real “write-of f”would be recorded by the accountant .) 3.This schedule does not tell the reader anything about the profitability of the accounts (butnei- ther does theACP ). It could very well be, for instance, that account #1, which apparently pays well,is also purchasing very low mar gin prod- ucts. While not necessarily of great importance to the Accounts R eceivable manager , the mar- keting manager may be very interested in prof- itability . 4.Overall, it appears that the company133 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nhas$425/$700, or 60.7% of its receivables that are “current ,” i.e., not past due – assuming 30-days collection terms . 5.The Aging Schedule implies a certain ACP .In order to calculate the ACP , it is necessary to know the Credit Sales figure, which is publicly available from the company’ s Income State- ment.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 134\\n\\n5.8 Solv ency Ratios Solvency has to do with the firm’ s ongoing ability to gener- atesufficient liquidity from Operating Earnings (EBIT) in order to meet its continuing debt-service obligations , par- ticularly interest payments, timely and fully .The two most common solvency ratios have to do with “leverage,” or the extent to which the firm employs debt as a source of capital as opposed to using equity . Some debt is desirable as it allows the firm’ s owners or shareholders to exploit “other people’ s money” ( OPM ) in order to earn greater profits on a per share basis than they would in the absence of debt , i.e., OPM . Too much debt, however , may be a bad thing as it increases the firm’ s riski- ness by adding on an increasing requirement to payinterest on the debt. “TIE” Ratio = Times Inter est Earned ( orInter est Cov- erage) = EBIT ÷Inter est Expense EBIT stands for “Earnings before Interest and T axes.” Over time, a company’ s operating earnings (EBIT) may fluctuate, the extent of whi ch fluctuation depends on the company’ s business and its industry . For example, a lawn- mower (or snowmobile) manufacturer will have high sales and inventory at certain times of year and low at other times; we refer to this phenomenon as “seasonality .” The company’ s interest expnses is relatively flat over time because the company does not often borrow and its interest expenses are fixed.135 Kenneth S.Bigel 135\\n\\nIn any case, this ratio looks at the extent to which EBIT exceeds the interest expense on its debt over time. Is this margin (or buf fer) a “safe” amount? (Some analysts will add back depreciation and amortization to EBIT to arrive at “EBITDA” – operating cash flow – on the rationale that interest is paid with cash.) In the diagram below , you will find inserted three possible EBIT curves for a fictitious firm; each possibility is rep- resented by a dif ferent colored curve.. The “wavier” the EBIT line, the more volatile its operating earnings are/will beover the course of some period s or years . The question is: overall, which curve represents the most secure TIE ratio and why? T he implications profoundly relate to the firm’ s Solvency! EBIT may look like a kind of horizontal squiggle, thesquigglyness of which depends on the volatility of the firm’ s operating earnings. The question then is whether interest expense (the straight horizontal line), which should be relatively flat over time, is above, below , or somewhere in the middle of the squiggle. Interest expense would appear as a horizontal line, since it is relatively flat over time because the company’ s level of indebtedness changes little, if at all, over time. Again, the company’ s EBIT should be suf ficiently above the interest expense line ,the extent of which dif ferentialIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 136\\n\\ndepends on the nature of the company’ s business and the manner in which the company is managed. A contingency may arise that if EBIT is low relative to (or worse ,below) the interest expense, will the firm have the capacity to make the required and timely (cash) payment of inter- est?Persistent insolvency may lead to bankruptcy . Debt ÷ NW By “NW ,” we mean “net worth,” or (total) “equity” (remember the basic accounting equation: A – L = NW). Analysts will disagree as to what is meant by “debt.” Some will concern themselves only with long-term liabil- ities; others will include current liabilities among “Debt.” In most instances, and for our present use, we will refer to “total liabilities” as debt, a reasonable default assumption since Debt + NW = 100% of assets , thus excluding nothing on the Balance Sheet . While one cannot say what the ideal “ debt-to-net-worth ratio” ought to be, it is safe to say that as the ratio increases, thecompany’ s ongoing ability to service its debt (i.e., to pay interest in particular) is reduced, and the likelihood of bankruptcy increases. In general, the ratio will change from industry to industry . Some industries are character- ized by greater indebtedness, or “leverage” than others. Wewill have more to say about this later . This ratio may be less than or greater than one. In the Balance Sheet to the right, the Debt-to-Net W orth Ratio is 500:500 or 1:1, “one to one.” The T otal Assets are $1,000.137 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nDebt ÷TA The default option for defining “debt” is again “total liabil- ities.” Again, remember that T otal Assets = Debt + Equity (TA = D + Eq). In this case, as the ratio increases, the com- pany’ s solvency becomes increasingly at risk. This ratio should notbe thought of as “coverage” ratios, in the same sense that the current and quick ratios are (or for that matter as the TIEratio is). In the latter cases, we view the adequacy (or inadequacy) of current assets as suf ficient – or not – to pay for the company’ s current liabilities. The firm needs liquid current assets to pay of f its current liabil- ities. Such is not the correct manner ,in which to interpret the debt ratios. The company does not need itsequity to “pay off” its debts! It i s incorrect to say that the net worth, or equity , of the company is “adequate ”in this sense . The only time that that equity will be used to pay of f debt is in theworst case of bankruptcy and (net) asset liquidation! In most cases, you will be analyzing an ongoing enterprise, not a bankrupt one. Instead ,these two debt ratios (D/NW and D/T A)aresim- plymeasures of the magnitude of a company’ s indebted- ness and, as such, are useful in comparison to other compan ies in its industry ,and to itself over time. Does XYZ Corporation have a lot of debt in comparison (or in propor- tionto) to its industry peers? Is its indebtedness increasing? A more useful solvency coverage ratio, if you are looking for on ethat most directly addresses solvency , is the “T imes Interest Earned” ratio, above .The “ TIE” ratio provides aIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 138\\n\\nLeveragegauge of the company’ s ability to pay ( i.e., to “cover”) the interest payable (or paid) on its debt. The D/T A ratio above would be 500/1,000 or 50%. While the D/NW is more popular , the D/T A ratio gives the analyst animaginary range of 0-100% of debt in comparison to total assets. The D/NW ratio gives no such reasonable range. In any case, one ratio can be easily inferred from the other . Total Assets ÷Equity Another solvency ratio is D / T A. This ratio will be pre- sented and discussed when we get to the “DuPont Model” somewhat later (see Sections 6.3 and 6.4). In summary , the more debt a company has relative to either its Equity or its T otal Assets, the more leverage it is said to have, by definition. In Physics, a “lever” allows one to get more output with the same input as compared to not using the lever . “If at First…. ” I can accept failur e; everyone fails at something.

Each of the foregoing data (without the word “mar gin”)may be divided by “T otal Sales” and used cross-sectionally or lon- gitudinally . “Mar gin” means percentage. For example, gross profit mar gin = gross profits ÷ sales. In discussing liquidity ratios, we agreed that in order tomanage liquidity risk the current ratio should be at least one.We can also agree thattoo high a current ratio may be unhealthy . This is because current assets, especially cash, produce no return . Having inventory sitting around does no good. A question to ask is: Why has the firm accumu- lated cash and other current assets rather than investing in more productive, fixed assets? There must be a balance between liquidity on the one hand, and return (see below) on the other .Too much of anything may not be good. Even though the firm may have high profitability , it does not mean that its cash flow position is strong. One must also examine the solvency ratios, especially the TIEratio.143 Kenneth S.Bigel 143\\n\\nThe company may have onerous obligations due to matur- ing debt and the need for replacement of long-term assets. A growing company may need a great deal of liquidity , in order to support growing sales, which growth would be reflected in growing inventory and accounts receiv- able. The analyst should also check the firm’ sLiquidity . Return Measur es: We will discuss two important return measures. These ratios give the analyst another look at prof- itability . ROA = Return on Assets = EBIT ÷TA How well is a firm employing its assets? Return on Assets attempts to gauge this. While many will use net income in the numer ator, EBIT is preferable in the sense that operat- ing profits reflect what the assets produce, whereas net income is af fected by the firm’ s capital structure ,i.e., interest expense andparticularly taxes, and othe r possible items not directly associated with the firm’ s actual busi- ness or “operations.” ROA may be a good tool to judge management’ s operat- ing performance and its “asset utilization ,”or how effi- ciently itexploits the firm’ s assets. Why may two, otherwise identical companies, have dif ferent ROAs? Does one company manage better? Does it motivate its employees better? Are they better trained? Do they work harder or longer hours? Does it employ better technology? ROE = Return on Equity = NI ÷EquityIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 144\\n\\nCommon shareholders are most interested in ROE because that is what they get for their equity investment. They understand that for each dollar of equity invested, they will have a claim on the company’ s net income, i.e., its divi- dends and (additions to) retained earnings. What kind of return is the firm able to produce on its equity? Equity is the result of,notjust the company’ s past operating performance (EBIT) andits associated accumu- lation of retained earnings, but management’ scapital struc- turedecision s(i.e., the debt/equity ratio) when it had to raise capital in the past. T he more debt there is ,the lessequity ;the more interest expense ,the less net income. EBIT also af fects Net Income! While ROA reflects the firm’ s effectiveness in producing operating profits, or EBIT , the ef fective use of leverage, i.e., debt, can increase the firm’ s ROE above its ROA. This is notguaranteed; borrowing does not en sure in all instances that ROE > ROA. In addition ,“leverage ,”i.e., the use of debt ( OPM ),increases the firm’ s financial , or solvency ,risk. We shall get a glimpse of this when we – soon – look into the DuPont model on the very next page. ROA and Leverage (i.e., the extent to which a firm utilizes debt) are inter -related. Stay tuned. ROE may be a better tool (t han ROA) for assessing a firm’ s(equity) investment merits, because shareholders are most interested in net income as that will either be distrib- utedto them as dividends and/or added to retained earn- ings, which are “owned” by shareholders. Once again, w hat is management providing thesharehold- ersfor their equity investment ?Shareholders are interested in earnings, as it is earnings, which are either paid out as145 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\ndividends or retained, andthatis what benefit sthe share- holders . Remember: retained earn ings belong to the com- mon shareholders. Asset T urnover: S÷Fixed Assets andS÷TA Here “turnover” is not a physical concept as it was when we spoke about Inventory T urnover .How often do the firm’ sFixed Assets (i.e.,Property , Plant, and Equip- ment) ,or total assets, “turn over ”relative to sales? In other words, how much Sales does a company produce from its fixed or total assets? If two identical firms dif fer in only this respect, what might the analyst conclude? Does one firm maximize price and revenues? Does one firm manage production and exploit its asse ts more ef fi- ciently ,more productively ?What do turnover ratios say about pricing, asset utilization ,and management perfor- mance? An analyst may prefer using total assets rather than just fixed assets, in this analysis, if the company being ana- lyzed is a service company with fewer fixed assets to speak ofin comparison with a heavy manufacturing firm .An ana- lyst may use Asset T urnover rather than Return Ratios in the case where EBIT = 0. If you take shortcuts, you get cut short. -Gary Busey , actorIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 146\\n\\n6.3 The DuP ont Model The DuPont Model was developed by managers at the DuPont Chemical Corporation for purposes of internally pinpointing strengths and weaknesses within the com- pany’ s management hierarchy .Imagine you are at the top of the corporation, that you are the chairman of the board or CEO ,and you answer to the company’ s share- holders. Ar guably , the one ratio you are most interested in would be the company’ s return-on-equity ratio. Whether the ROE looks good or bad, you would wish to look fur- ther into the performance of the company , make improve- ments, increase ef ficiency , and buttress strong areas. The DuPont formula provides upper management with a top-down look into the company’ s performance culminat- ingwith ROE, which, again, is of the most interest to com- pany shareholders. The CEO looks into three critical areas : 1.Profitability (“Profit Mar gin” – see below) ,2.Operatin g (“Total Asset T urnover”) , and 3. F inancial perspec- tives (“Leverage”) .147 Kenneth S.Bigel 147\\n\\nSome Key Points: 1.Good business management produces a favor- able ROA. 2.Proper leverage may enhance the investor ’s return – ROE. W ithout Leverage, ROA = ROE. 3.You will notice that the ROA and Leverage ratios do not match up with our earlier defini-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 148\\n\\ntions.149 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n6.4 What Does the Dupont Model Show Us? The Dupont Model enables us to locate the sources of corporate performance . Imagine you are CEO and have to report performance to shareholders. First, looking top-down, you are interested in ROE. The model shows us the ef fect of leverage on ROE, given the prior level of ROA. Then, it ascribes operating performance, as defined by ROA, as being attributable to Profit Mar gin and T otal Asset Turnover . This enables executives to locate areas of weak- ness within the firm and address them. Let’s illustrate how Leverage benefits an unnamed corpo- ration, given its ROA. Let’s assume the following: Debt = $700 Equity = $300 Total Assets = $1,000 Net Income = $100 Therefore:Introduction toFinancial Analysis 150 150\\n\\nROA = NI / T A = 100 / 1,000 = 0.10 Leverage = Total Assets / Equity = 1,000 / 300 = 3.34 ROE = ROA x Leverage = (0.10) (3.34) = 0.34 Leverage has increased the corporation’ sROE! Alternatively , let’ s say the company has no leverage, but the same in T otal Assets. In other words, the assets are financed in full by equity only . ROA = 100 / 1,000 = 0.10 Leverage = 1,000 / 1,000 = 1.0 ROE = (0.10) (1.0) = 0.10 Without anyLeverage at all , ROE = ROA. Of course, Leverage is not something that the company should employ indiscr imina tely. Too much debt will raise interest expense topossibly unsustainable levels and thus could have a weakening ef fect on the TIE ratio, leading eventually to insolvency and bankruptcy –in the worst case. The DuPont Model does not address this risk. The Dupont Model is useful for assessment of past perfor- mance. It is a poor planning tool. Looking at this exam- ple, one may be encouraged to employ more and more risk. Of course, as just noted, too much debt is not necessarily a good thing: it increases the risk of becoming insolvent – causing the TIE Ratio to be below one.151 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n6.5 Financial Ratios in Action Liquidity and Pr ofitability: Costco Costco, when you look at it, is a very basic kind of busi- ness.

For example, if a company earned $1 mil- lion and has 500,000 shares outstanding, its EPS is $2 per share. This, rather than the dollar price, may be used as a measure of “cheapness” or “expensiveness” of a stock. “V alue” stocks are generally characterized by low PE ratios. A Value Stock may be thought of as such because its price – relative to itsearnings – represents a “good buy” for the money , i.e., cheaper . The analyst must be cognizant of the possibility that a low PE may also mean that its future earnings prospects are generally deemed unfavor- able. In contrast, Growth Stocks will reflect (very) high PEs on the basis of generally optimistic views of future earnings growth. Does this mean that earnings willnecessarily catch up with price? Let’s say that a company’ s PE = $50/$1 = 50 times earnings. That is a very157 Kenneth S.Bigel 157\\n\\nGrowth Stockhigh ratio. If the market anticipates next year’s earnings to double, the stock may be said to be trading at just $50/$2 = 25times next year ’s earnings , a more rea- sonable ratio. High PEs are the ef fect of thehigh expec- tations the market has for future growth in a com- pany’ searnings. As a company’ s earnings grow in the future, the multiple that one paid for his shares goes down, making the purchase, with the benefit of hindsight, a good choice. For example, if a company earns $1 per share and sells for $50, its PE will equal 50x earnings, quite high, quite “expensive” for what you get. If ,however ,the earnings next year do indeed grow to say , $5 per share, the buyer at last year ’s price w hopurchased the stock for a meager $50, oronly 10x next year ’s earnings , got a good deal .There- fore, companies with h igh growth expectations will mani- fest higher PE ratios than the boring companies with low growth prospects. A stock analyst might have said that the PE ratio is now 50x, but only 10x next year ’sexpected earn- ings – if s/he so prophesied. At the time this is being written, average PE ratios for the S& P 500 Index of (publicly-traded) stocks are approxi- mately “20 times earnings.” Why would someone pay so much for each dollar of earnings? In contrast, privately- owned stocks, i.e., those not traded on the public-markets, will have much lower PE ratios.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 158\\n\\nLiquidity PremiumOne explanation has to do with the Liq- uidity Pr emium associated with publicly traded stocks. “Liquidity” has to do with the ease and speed with which a seller can convert an asset, in this case stock, into cash while obtaining a sales price that represents that asset’ s true value, i.e., without reduction in price from its true, or “intrinsic” value. It is generally very easy to buy and sell a stock. All one needs to do is place an order with a stock- broker (and pay for it within the required three-day settle- ment period for stock). There is an added or premium value in this liquidity . That is why “Private Equity” investments can be so profitable. A private company will sell at a much lower PE ratio due to the lack of liquidity . If the company is later sold in an IPO (“initial public of fering” – the point at which time a stock is sold to the public for the first time), there will be much profit to go around! The true cost of buying a privately owned company , i.e., one whose stock or equity is not traded on the public stock exchanges, is not embedded in the price one pays for buying such private corporations. In order to purchase a privately owned company , one has to search for an appro- priate one, one that is also available to purchase. This involved time and time is money . The potential buyer is spending time engaged in the search rather than pursuing other profitable opportunities. This is not an issue where publicly traded stock is concerned. These companies are readily available for rapid purchase and sale. Moreover , in order to buy a private company , one must employ the services of an attorney to negotiate and close159 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nCash-on- cash Returnthe deal. Bankers must be involved because private stock is usually purchased with lar ge (and often borrowed) sums as opposed to the purchase of a minimum number of shares of stock in a publicly traded stock corporation with few funds. These other costs must be reflected as opportunity costs and thus, under the “Law of One Price” ought to be reflected in the prices of publicly traded stock. Law of One Price requires that similar assets ought to be priced simi- larly. There are certain demerits to the PE Ratio. For instance, Earnings aresubject to accrual account- ingmanipulation s. Moreover , companies with very low ornegative earnings yield ameaningless PE ratio. A com- pany with low earnings may command a ridiculously high PE. A company with negative earnings will not yield a PE at all – it is not computable! Dividend Y ield = D per shar e÷Ppershare One may view this as the Cash-on-cash Return that a stock may provide. If I pay $10 for YawrCo.stock and it pays anannual dividend of $1, my “cash- on-cash return ”or dividend yield is 10%. Some industries will reflect higher divi- dend yields than others . Dividends are usually paid from current net income, but if there are losses ,dividends would have to be paid from retained earnings. T ypi- cally , mature, rather than growth compa- nies,pay high dividends. This yield ignores price changes.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 160\\n\\nTotal Return Signal SignalingIt is eminently noteworthy that the divi- dend yield excludes any capital growth, which is integral to YawrCo. stock’ s Total Return . In other words, the T otal Return equals the dividend yield plus the capital gain (or loss) expressed in per- centage terms. If you purchased thisstock for $10 and sold it at $15, your capital gain would be 50%. The T otal Return is: 10% + 50% = 60%. It is often considered a positive Signal that a company maintains its dividend in the face of losses. This Signal- ingindicates manage- ment’ s optimism about future earnings prospects. The dividend itself thus boils down to a “human decision” by the firm’ s board of directors, rather than a measure of business performance per se. If the board feels that the future is good, it may choose to pay dividends even if the company is presently losing money . Dividend Payout Ratio = PR = D Total ÷ NI = DPS ÷ EPS This ratio indicates the percentage of net income, which is paid out to common shareholders as div- idends. If a firm earns $1,000,000 and pays $100,000 in dividends, its payout ratio is 10%. If there is preferred stock, the preferred dividends161 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nwould first have to be deducted from the net income. The PR formula would be adjusted: PR = (Common Stock Dividends) ÷ (Net Income – Pre- ferred Stock Dividends). Retention Rate = RR = 1 – PR = (NI – D Total ) ÷ NI = ARE ÷ NI This ratio indicates how much of the company’ s earnings are retained internally for future growth and, as such, together with the firm’ s ROE impact the firm’ s growth potential. On the next page, we discuss the relationship between earnings retention and firm’ s growth. (This will be explicated further below in the “EFN Model.”) Naturally , PR + RR = 1.0 = 100%.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 162\\n\\n7.3 Earnings Retention and Growth Our working assumption is that the firm has a never -ending appetite for growth. In order to grow its sales, and hope- fully its profits thereby , the firm must retain some of its earnings and invest them in productive assets that can be exploited to increase sales in the future. Let’sexamine the following company: If the company’ s ROE is assumed to be constant, i.e., one of those ceteris paribus assumptions, then the numbers next year will be: So, as we see, earnings retention is helpful for growth. Had the company not invested its A.R.E. in productive assets,163 Kenneth S.Bigel 163\\n\\nitsROE would have declined ,as would its prospective growth rate. Companies that have great growth prospects will therefore pay no dividends due to its hunger for using the entirety of its Net Income as Additions to Retained Earnings in order to increase its assets.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 164\\n\\n7.4 The P/BV (Price-to-Book V alue ) and P/E (Price-Earnings) Ratios The price of a stock alone does not tell you anything about its value. T ake two stocks, one of which is trading at $20 and has 1,000,000 shares outstanding, while the other trades at $10 and has 2,000,000 shares outstanding. Which one has greater value? They are both the same! Instead, we will look at relative value, i.e., price relative to either of two measures: Book V alue (BV) per share and Earnings per share (EPS). Book V alue per share is mea- sured by the accountant’ s assessment of the company’ s equity (excluding preferred stock, if any) divided by the company’ s number of (common) equity shares outstanding (NOSO). W e already know how to calculate EPS. Let’s take the example of two companies that have the same share price, the same number of shares outstanding, but dif ferent book values per share (i.e., assets minus liabil- ities divided by the number of shares outstanding). Which stock is a better “value”? Which is a better investment? At the same price, it seems that LCM is a better buy .LCM provides greater BV for each dollar of share price. Clearly , while the market price alone does not necessarily tell you165 Kenneth S.Bigel 165\\n\\nwhether the stock is a “good buy” or not (both stocks here have the same price), there is alsosome question as to whether Book Value is a reasonable measure. The balance sheet perspective (i.e., “account- ingbook value,” or the company’ s net assets) depicted above is fraught with the many interpre- tiveaccrual accounting problems enumerated ear- lier(specifically , we enumerated four issues). There islikely more historical bias embedded in book value than in earnings. On the other hand, Price-to-Book (P/BV) tends to be amore stable measure than the PE ratio. Further , P/ BVignores how well management utilizes the assets in producing earnings for shareholders. Earnings certainly matter! Earnings are what most shareholders focus on. Summary: Price-to-Book V alue Pro •More stable than PE Con •Subject to accrual accounting idiosyncrasies •Most shareholders focus on earnings •Ignores management ef fectiveness ◦Asset utilizationIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 166\\n\\n◦Earnings production Another way of making th eassessment of whether the stock price is “fair” or not, would be by looking at the stock’ sP/E ratio, i.e., Price (per share) ÷ Earnings (per share). How much does the prospective (or current) share- holder pay fora share of the stock in order for him to “earn” so much in terms of EPS? Remember that the shareholder is most interested in earnings per share because that is the source of his dividends and retained earnings, a portion of which he owns. In contrast to the first approach, this approach is income statement oriented. You should be able to calculate EPS and PE independently . EPS are $ 1 and $0.10 per share for LCM and TC respec- tively . Clearly , however , LCM is “cheaper ,” with a PE ratio of 10 0xearnings ,whereas TC reflects a ratio of 1,000x its earnings – if you accept PE as a valid valuation/pricing measure. (ThePE ratio spresented in this example aremuch higher than will be typically found in the markets – even in good times. )167 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nWhen an investor purchases a stock, s/he is making an investment in the company’ s ability to generate profits. (This is not to say that the assets have no value.) The prof- its, in turn will be either distributed to the shareholder as a (cash) dividend – or retained by the corporation and then reinvested in additional assets that should produce even more profits going forward. We have already cited the basic problems in utilizing (legit- imate) accounting data in the course of financial analysis. Was “book value” useful in this example? In recent years, management and its accountants have been very “creative” in the presentation of accounting summaries. Is EPS reli- able accounting-wise? The analyst has to be cognizant of alternative accounting presentations – both legitimate and not. Note regarding EPS calculation : The calculation for EPS presented above (i.e., net income ÷ the number of shares outstanding) is simplistic and should be used only when better data are not available. In fact, the accountant will present both “Basic” and“Diluted ”EPS, the calculation sfor which are quite involved. The student analyst must choose whether to uti- lize the Basic EPS datum in calculating the PE ratio or the Diluted version . The Diluted datum assumes that convertible and other “complex” securities have been converted to stock; this results in a lower EPS number . The theoretical supposition inherent in the Diluted earnings figure may make it inap-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 168\\n\\npropriate for use in PE valuation in the eyes of some ana- lysts.169 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n7.5 Ratio Analysis Ex ercise You are given the balance sheet and income statements forABC Corporation.

There are numerous sources for such industry data. Here are some useful ones. Bloomber g The Risk Management Association or RMA (once known as Robert Morris Associates).

Dun and Bradstreet or “D&B.” This consists of over 1 mil- lionfirms. ValueLine Investment Service They cover just about 1,700 firms, but also provide investment ratings for their listings. The Department of Commerce Standar d and Poor ’sor “S&P .” Moody’ s Yahoo Finance MSNIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 180 180\\n\\nMoney Central Note: We know that ratios do not provide answers. Similarly , no single ratio alone can provide an integrative view of the firm. Analysis requires a cross-sectional approach. Cross-sectional analysis will require combining ratios often across dif ferent industry categories in order to get a clearer picture of the goings-on of the firm.181 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n7.11 Some Limitations of Financial Ratios As we have learned, most financial ratios consist of accounting data, which are limited in interpretive useful- ness, but may be all we have. The astute analyst is aware of this and makes appropriate adjust ments . The principle ofGarbage-in, Garbage-out always pertains. Ratios are useless if the accounting data inputted aresuspect. Here are some issues to look out for . 1.Accrual Accounting data management :Garbage- in, Garbage-out. 2.Companies engage in Real Earnings “window- dressing” in order to make their statements appear in a certain manner; examples include pulling forward or deferring actual expenses. 3.Accounting policies dif fer from one firm to another , making cross-s ectional analysis dif fi- cult; for example, one compan y uses FIFO while another uses L IFO. 4.Ratios are “static” and do not necessarily reveal future relationships . 5.A ratio can hide problems lying underneath; an example would be a high Quick Ratio hiding a lot of bad accounts receivable . 6.Liabilities are not always disclosed; an example would be contingent liabilities due to lawsuit.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 182 182\\n\\nSince it may – or may not – happen, the accoun- tant will not disclose it. There has been no trans- action. (This may appear in the footnotes only .) 7.Companies are often in multiple lines of busi- ness. Therefore, identifying an industry group is virtually impossible, making cross-sectional analysis inef fective . 8.Industry benchmarks ( see prior page) are often only approximations , and inaccurate ones at that.Also, there are often data entry errors.183 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n7.12 Chapters 5 - 7: Review Questions 1.Calculate as many financial ratios as you can using the company from the last problem set.

The financial analyst gath- ers information from numerous sources. Where he gets his/her information will depend lar gely on who s/he is. There are two possibilities: Theinternal corporate analyst , i.e., the analyst who works for and “inside” the corporation, will collect information from the various com- pany departments including marketing, purchasing , admin- istration, economics, and other s,each of which will “sign off” on the data that s/he includes in his/her financial pro- jections. This analyst is char ged with compiling the data meaningfully and projecting the relative profitability and hence worthiness of alternative, and sometimes competing, possible investment projects. The purpose is to engage incorporate Financial Planning. For example, the sales projections may come from the mar-189 Kenneth S.Bigel 189\\n\\nketing department. This department may provide unit sales and pricing data, which the analyst compiles and includes in his/her projections. The analyst may ask that the depart- ment “sign of f”on this portion of the overall projections and thereby take some responsibility for the data. Alterna- tively , the analyst may investigate the reasonableness of the data and provide alternative projections. Theexternal (securities) analyst, i.e., one who isnotemployed by the subject corporation, but perhaps who works instead for a financial institution thathassome investment or equity interest in the corpora- tion, will not have access to the same valuable informa- tionand data that the internal corporate analyst will have. The methods s/he uses will dif fer accordingly . The external analyst does not have access to the data regarding cor- porate investment projects adopted andwhich are now just coming on-line, or recently came online. S/he there- forewilluse public financial statements in order to derive inferences about the corporation’ s growth prospects and future share price. When we, individuals, think of “investing,” many of us think of investing in stocks and bonds. This is not typically what companies invest in. What do(non-financial) corpo- rations “invest” in? Let us remember that, here, we are all financial analysts and hence we take on a “corporate perspective.” In this sense, corporate investment refers to things that (non- financial) corporations invest in, in order to main- tainandgrowtheir businesses. Such investments include, but are not limited to, the following: •Property , plant, and equipment – P , P, & EIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 190\\n\\n•Inventory •Research & Development (R&D) – we will not deal with R&D in our forthcoming discussions. Some very useful definitions : •Expense : a reduction (debit) to revenues, reported on the Income Statement. Some expenses involve the movement of cash, e.g., wages; others do not, e.g., depreciation. •Expenditure : involves the movement of cash – an outlay or outflow of funds, which may either be expensed and/or capitalized. If “capitalized,” it will be expensed as depreciation over future years. P , P, & E fit this category . Remember , land (“property”) is not depreciable even though it is capitalized. In contrast, (cash-) dividends are expenditures that involve cash outlays; divi- dends are not expensed because they are returns to the owners. Below you will find some examples of expenses and expenditures. Expense Expenditure Wages Yes Yes Depreciation Yes No Property No Yes191 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n8.3 Pro-F orma (Projected) Cash Flow Analysis Estimating future cash flows :Whether s/heisinternal or external , the analyst is involved in projecting future (accounting) profits and often, more importantly , projected netcash flows. In order to gather these data, the internal analyst must involve d ifferent departments , thereby playing corporate “politics ”in order to complete the job . For each of the following, indicate from which department the projections may come (e.g., economics, marketing, purchasing, etc.) . Unit Sales First, the internal analyst may receive unit sales projections from the marketing department. The analyst must also be aware of the issue of Cannibal- ization –the detrimental ef fect on other sales of the intro- duction of the new project (see section #8.4). For example, if Microsoft projects sales of two million units of W indows Vista, of which one million would have otherwise gone to W indows XP sales, the analyst would recognize on his spreadsheet only the one-million-unit increment. This is because the decision to introduce a new product came, inasense ,at the expense of the old product’ s sales. Ana- lysts are interested only in what the new product con-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 192 192\\n\\ntributes incrementally – above and beyond present matters. Sales Prices Inorder to project future revenues, the analyst will thus possibly need to obtain both unit sales data (i.e., expected quantities sold) and “pricing” information (i.e., expected price per unit). Operating Costs This information may be derived from many dif ferent par- ties, e.g., purchasing, operations, etc. Operating costs may include: •Cost of Goods Sold : This refers to inventory costs as explained earlier . •Selling, general, and administrative costs :These costs refer to non-production expenditures, including salaries and wages, rent, advertising, and travel. •Taxes: Although taxes are not an operating cost per se, we all know what Ben Franklin said about “death and taxes.” Since taxes cannot be avoided, they should be deducted in the analy- sis. Non-operating and Capital Costs In “spreading the numbers,” the internal analyst will pay attention only to projected operating data, and not to any capital or other non-operating data / costs. S/he is inter-193 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nKey Terms: Cost of Capitalested usually only in what the potential project will pro- duce as a business enterprise alone. Capital costs include the cost of paying interest on debt, and the dividend and“growth” costs of equity . As a heads-up, t hecost of capital is an issue with which we shall deal later in great depth. Once the ana- lyst has arrived at the yearly operat- ingnumbers, usually projected cash flow (rather than accounting prof- its), the cost of capital will then be brought in as the “discount rate,” rather than as a dollar figure. This is the rate at which the future cash flows will be “discounted ,” or translated ,to present values, thereby enabling a level playing field, in terms of time. In other words, by discounting, we are able to equate the value of a dollar paid tomorrow with a dollar today .This way , an investment decision may be made based on profitability and possibly other measures. Note : As we continue through these readings, pay careful atten- tion to the words “expense” and “expenditure.” They are not the same. “Expense” is an accounting phrase reflected on the Income Statement ; expense i s a reduction to NetIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 194\\n\\nIncome – it may or may not involve cash . “Expenditure” refers to the deployment of funds – it will involve cash butmay or may not be expensed. Expenditures may be cap- italized or expensed.195 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nKey Terms: Incremen- tal Incremen- talism8.4 Incrementalism The analyst’ s “end-game” is to produce a spreadsheet reflecting future years’ respective, incremental , or additional, cash flows and/or profits, and possibly other things as well. In general, the prin- ciple of incrementalism pertains. It is only incremental cash flows, i.e., those which are added due to the project’ s implementation, which are relevant to decision-making. If the company brought in $100 and now – with the new project – it brings in $125, the increment is $25. Incremental revenues –and costs –did not exist before the project waseffected. Therefore, sunk costs and the cannibal- izedportions of projections’ data are excluded as will be discussed immediately below .It is the incremental data which drive the decision to invest or not. W e will learn this better by example. By contrast, the accountant reports allhistorical economic events. Later , we will conduct a basic exercise in producing a pro-forma statement , i.e., aprojected, income state- ment. Below are the two types of incrementalism:Introduction toFinancial Analysis 196 196\\n\\nSunk Costs Cannibal- izationSunk Costs –these are expenditures which have already been outlaid and should not be therefore “double- counted.” For example, suppose a factory has unused , or under -used, equipment, which may be exploited, for a proposed project. The cost of the equipment having already been spent or “sunk,” should not be considered again; the cost is not rele- vant to deciding, for example, whether or notan existing asset should be exploited in a new way . The project merely proposes to exploit unused, or under -uti- lized, assets –or“sunk costs ”–in order to increase sales and profits. Cannibalization – When a new product is introduced, some of the revenue may have been cannibalized from the potential sales of the old product. For example, if the new product is expected to sell 1.5 million units, and the old product hadsold 1.0 million, we are interested only in the 0.5 mm increment. That is what the investment decision depends upon. Hence the phrase “cannibalization.” A change in pricing would complicate this analysis, i.e., how much of the revenue increase is due to volume and how much is due to a price increase?197 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n8.5 Corpor ate F orecasting and Str ategic Planning A financial analyst will collect reliable financial data from internal numerous sources, if possible, which s/he will cite in his/her forecast, list the assumptions as part of the report, and “spread the numbers” accordingly . Interpretation and strategy then will follow . The following is an exercise in creating a pro forma (accounting-based) income statement. Later , we will see some analytic techniques, which may be implemented to convert “profits” to “cash flow ,” if the latter is deemed more desirable. A “strategic plan” involves forecasting financial data for multiple future years. Pro forma Financial Statements Complete the pro forma I/S based on the follow- ingassumptions : 1.Marketing projects sales growth at 10% p.a. 2.“Purchasing ”projects inventory costs to rise at a rate of 12% p.a. – due to scarcities . 3.S, G, & A will grow at a rate of 8% p.a. 4.For depreciation, see information below . 5.Interest costs will rise due to acquisition of new property ,$10,000 of which will be financed entirely via a 20-year , “non-amortizing” mort-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 198 198\\n\\ngage (i.e., interest-only) bond at a rate of 7.5%.

Depreciation •Next year ’s(“Year 1″) depreciation expense will be $50. Thereafter the (old) building will be scrapped. •At the end of Y ear 1, a new building will be in use (the cost of scrapping the old building will be included in the cost basis of the new build- ing). At that time, a mortgage will be in place. The new building will cost $1 1,000 and will have a twenty-year life. It will be depreci- ated on a straight-line basis; asalvage value of $1,000 is assumed.199 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 200\\n\\n8.6 F orecasting Solution Provide some interpretive statements or comments about this company’ s (or investment project’ s) prospects .Specif- ically , calculate the growth rates for each year versus its prior year – for GP , EBIT , and NI. The Growth Rate is calculated as: (Next Y ear’s Num- ber÷Last Y ear’s number) – 1. For example, how much higher , in percentage terms, is the GP for “Y ear 1” in comparison to “Last Y ear”? Do this for each year until you get to Five versus (or “over”) Four .201 Kenneth S.Bigel 201\\n\\nUse four decimal places throughout. What do you find and why?Introduction toFinancial Analysis 202\\n\\n8.7 The T ax Effect of Depreciation Depr eciation is a non-cash expense (and NOT an “expen- diture”) , which serves to recognize the consumption of fixed assets over time , e.g.,plant and equipment, but NOT property . The“consumption ,” or use, of long-term, fixed assets is reflected as a separate operating, depreciation expense. Although depreciation is a non-cash expense, it provides the corporation with cash because it reduces taxable income and hence the tax liability . When depreciation can be “imputed ”to the manufacturing process, its char ges are included in the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS ).For example, if the manufacturer of a $1 mil- lion piece of equipment warrants that the machine will be used up after manufacturing 1 million units, the accoun- tant may impute (i.e., include) $1 per unit of production to COGS. This could confuse the statements reader . Below , we will notassume such “imputation.” Illustration of Depreciation T ax Shield (Ignoring Interest Expense) :203 Kenneth S.Bigel 203\\n\\nDue to depreciation, a non-cash expense, net income will be lower by only $12 rather than the full $20 of depreci- ation expensed; the $8 dif ference represents the tax sav- ings, and hence the “tax shield,” due to the deduction of the depreciation expense. Tax Shield = (D) (T) = ($20) ( 0.40) = $8 The “tax shield” of depreciation, i.e., D (T) , is a very real phenomenon in that it actually reduces the tax burden, which is viewed as a provision of cash, albeit depreciation alone provides no cash. The acquisition of a depreciable asset , e.g., a building or equipment, creates a tax shield or benefit that provides more cash flow than before the acquisition. You may think of “EBITDA” (i.e., earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) as EBIT plus depreci- ation (and amortization ).

A corporation’ s value is dependent, in large part, on the income and cash flow it produces. Cash flow is dif ferent from income in that “income” is based on “accrual accounting,” which will reflect certain non- cash events such as depreciation, and many other “dis- tortions,” some of which were discussed earlier . One key distortion had to do with “timing” – the accountant may book a sale, for example when “constructively received,” i.e., when legally and economically receivable, but not yet received in actual cash. Under accrual accounting, the accountant records eco- nomic transactions rather than the movement of actual cash received and paid out. (In theory , in the long run such accounting vs. cash dif ferences even out.) Because of these differences, financial analysts, who are more cash-oriented, must make certain adjustments to the accounting data in their own calculations and projections. In a certain sense, cash flow is more important to corporate valuation than income because dividends are paid out to investors in cash. Further , when engaging in corporate planning, a possible capital investment will be judged attractive dependent upon the cash flow it produces in the future because it is cash that, ar guably , fuels growth. What is Free Cash Flow ? Capital investments, i.e., “growth” investments, include expenditures for hard assets, as well as for product development, and much more.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 208 208\\n\\n“Free cash flow” is funds that an investment project or the corporation as a whole generates beyond its own internal and ongoing needs. W e may think of free cash flow as the cash, which is left over from an investment project, after all net operating funds generated by the project are uti- lized for necessary , non-discretionary purposes, including hard assets’ maintenance and replacement, and increases in working capital; this “left-over” amount may be used for other financial purposes – growth or expansion, at the dis- cretion of management. Working capital must often be increased. The project, or corporation, first generates operating cash flows, some of which are needed to replace or maintain assets, to invest in inventory and receivables, and to maintain the firm’ s com- petitive position. So, think of “free” cash flow (FCF) as discr etionary , think of it as “ Discr etionary Cash Flow .”Necessary capital and other non-discretionary expenditures are required in order to maintain the business as is. A leaky roof must be repaired; there is no choice. A worn-out gasket must be replaced. Analogously , you may recall the parallel notion of “dispos- able income” in Macroeconomics. (After deducting taxes, and necessities, such as food and rent, from gross income, the consumer has some funds left over for discretionary purposes, which might include investment, or buying that deluxe Apple W atch s/he has coveted for so long.) Simi- larly, “free cash flow” is the net, operating after -tax cash that the firm may generate from investment in a new build- ing or equipment (i.e., the investment “project”) after con- sidering necessary operating and capital expenditures, including maintenance and replacement, but excluding209 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nexpansionary , or growth-oriented, capital expenditures as this would be discretionary . The more FCF the firm generates, the greater the firm’ s ability to invest in new assets, to use the funds to pay down debt or to pay dividends, and still other discretionary pos- sibilities. The Mathematics One formula for use inthis process is presented below .We start with operating earnings, which, in this case, is defined as“EBIT” or , alternatively “EBITDA1 ,”i.e., earn- ings before interest, taxes, and amortization2 . To the finan- cial analyst, the projected income or cash flow statement may look something like the following: Thus the analyst would calculate Free Cash Flow (FCF) to equal: [(EBIT DA)(1 – T) ]+[(Depr eciation )(T)]–[Neces- 1.In some instances, an analyst may choose to use “EBITDA,” i.e., EBIT with depreciation and amortization added back. The use of this figure will depend on the data presentation and analyst choice. 2.As we will learn later in this text, amortization has to do with the reduction in the value of an intangible asset over time; in this sense it is like deprecia- tion.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 210\\n\\nsary Capital Expenditur es]–[Increase in Net W orking Capital ] The elements of the formula The formula consists of four different parts. Let’ s look at each of them. 1.EBITDA (1 – T) 2.Add: Depreciation (T ax Rate) = (D) × (T) 3.Less: Necessary Capital Expenditures3 4.Less: Increases in Net W orking Capital 5.Equals: Free Cash Flow (FCF) Note that “T” (in “1-T” and in “D x T” )stands for the firm’ s tax bracket , or percent , whereas EBITDA is in dol- lars, including the “T” there. While at this stage of the cor- porate planning and investment analysis process, the firm has not yet decided whether it will choose the investment or not and, if so, how it will be financed, and therefore does not know its projected interest payments, it does know its tax bracket, which is based on the firm’ smeeting a speci- fied lower threshold (“bracket”) of earnings. 1.EBITDA : Takenote of the use of EBIT DArather than EBT in the formula .There are several details here, which bear expla- nation; we will take them one at a time. First, account- 3.Note that “Capital Expenditures” here refers only to requir edexpenditures, i.e., maintenance and replacement expenditures, and notdiscr etionary expenditures, which may be used for expansion and growth. By subtracting out necessary (i.e., non-discretionary) CE, we are left with Free CF .211 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\ningEBT would include interest expense – as a deduction from EBIT .“Interest expense” isthe result of aprior capi- talfinancing decision and, as such, should b e independent of this analysis , which focuses on the cash-based, operat- ingearnings a firm or a project produces (EBITDA) ,and not on financial decisions .In our analysis and projections, we should thus exclude interest , which is a discretionary capital structure, solvency-oriented matter for decision . Accordingly , the “EBITDA (1 – T)” adjustment elimi- nates the interaction of interest and its ef fect on tax. To see how this adjustment works, let us compare the results of the formula with the following alternate spreadsheet pre- sentation. Let’ s say that the firm produces $100,000 of EBITDA, has interest expense of $20,000, and pays taxes at a 30% rate. By formula we would project EBITDA (1 – T) = $100,000 (1 – .30) = $70,000 .(For this example, we shall assume, for the moment, that depreciation and amor- tization are zero.) This is the figure we want, which repre- sents earnings after taxes, in the absence of interest. The “1 – T” multiplier shows what is left after paying taxes. This project produces, or is expected to produce, $70,000 in operating cash flow (next year). Inthe following spreadsheet, we would show the same $70,000 result , only by dif ferent presentation (in order to prove outthe formula) – under the alter- nate FCF analysis .We also show , side by side, the accounting income reported , which does not suit the pur- pose of the analysis because it includes interest expense, which is a financial – not an operating – event or cash (out- ) flow .Introduction toFinancial Analysis 212\\n\\n2.TheDepreciation Tax Shield : Depreciation is anon-cash expense (as is amortization, which we have been assuming herein to be zero), which is deducted fromoperating earnings befor eincome taxes. Therefore, we add back justthe tax savings that deprecia- tion provides but ignore depreciation itself. It is assumed that the (internal) analyst knows the firm’ s tax bracket. Depreciation is tax deductible and, as such pro- vides cash, but otherwise itself directly provides no cash. Youfound above an in-depth illustration of the “tax effect of depreciation,” absent other media. Y ou may wish to view that page again now. Note: EBITDA (1-T) + D (T) = EBIT (1-T) + D. (To prove this out, substitute in the equation the following values: EBIT = $100; D = $20; A = $0; and T = .30) The two phrases are mathematically equivalent but appear to have somewhat different connotations. In the latter case, EBIT appears to refer to accounting income, hence ourpreference forEBITDA , a more cash-oriented notion . In the latter for-213 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nmulation , adding back depreciation, which is a non-cash expense, intuitively appears to contradict the aforesaid idea that depreciation does not provide cash flow , even though it does work out mathematically and conceptually . 3.Capital Expenditures : There are the three categories of capital expenditures (“Cap Ex”) , which we shall need to incorporate in the free cash flow projection. They are: 1. Maintenance 2. Replacement 3. Expansion Occasionally , the walls must be painted and the premises properly maintained . Roofs may blow of f, and machinery gaskets may “blow ,” requiring replacement .Expansion- aryinvestments may involve acquiring additional factory space or equipment, in order to increase production, and hence sales and profits. Maintenance and replacement expenditures are clearly necessary ; expansionary expenditures are discr e- tionary and are (generally) undertaken in order to provide growth, i.e., increased sales and profits. We would deduct necessary capital expenditures in order to arrive at free cash flow . Accounting rules do not require separating out necessary from discretionary capital expenditures ; any breakdown, if provided, may be found in the footnotes. This informa- tion will assist the analyst in gauging the firm’ s growth prospects. Absent this breakdown , the most common prac-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 214\\n\\ntice among analysts is to use allcapital expenditures in the formula, although this is a matter of analyst judgment. 4. Net W orking Capital : “Net working capital” may be defined as current assets less current liabilities (NWC = CA – CL). Any increase incurrent assets, or in net current assets (i.e., “NWC ”), usesfinancial resources and thus reduces cash or cash flow . For example, an increase in inventory uses funds. Similarly , an increase in current liabilities provides funds , and may be thought of as a “source” of funds. A decrease in current liabilities uses funds. For example, when a com- pany pays itsaccounts payable, it uses funds. If a firm is to grow it will have to increase its Net W orking Capital. The table below summarizes the possibilities and instructs you how to insert the changes into the FCF formula. Some add to FCF;others are subtracted from FCF. Note that, in calculating Free Cash Flow and the relevant prospective changes in Current Assets, we ignore expected changes in the cash account, focusing instead on changes inthecash flow af fecting the cash account. T o include changes in the cash account itself in calculating FCF, would be “double-counting.”215 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nWhat can the corporation do with its FCF? •Purchase more P , P, & E. •Expand inventory . •Invest in Mer gers and Acquisitions (using shares when high-priced). •Increase R & D. •Pay of f Debt. •Pay discretionary (common stock) dividends. •Buy back common shares (when cheap). Apotential corporate investment project that throws of f a lot of FCF is desirable. A firm , as a whole, that throws of f lots of FCF may be thought of in a most positive light – as one, among other possibilities, that has a lot of growth potential and makes for a good investment.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 216\\n\\n9.3 F ree Cash Flow Ex ercises Free Cash Flow: Exercise #1 That covers the formula. Let us work up a quick , all inclu- sive, example. Y ou are given the following :solve for “free cash flow .”Assume that there is no amortization. [(EBITDA) (1 – T)] + [(Depr eciation) (T)] – [Necessary Capital Expenditur es] – [Incr ease in Net W orking Capital] FCF (Formulation) = $100 (1 – .30) + $1 (.30) – $7 – $2 (Calculation) = $70 + $0.30 – $7 – $2 = $61.3 million Working Capital next year versus this year increased by $2 million : (6-2) – (5-3) . Alternatively , one might say that current assets increased by $1 million, a useof funds; cur- rent liabilities decreased by $ 1 million, also a use of funds .217 Kenneth S.Bigel 217\\n\\nThe net use of funds was therefore $2 million, which accordingly reduces free cash flow . To summarize, free cash flow may be thought of as the firm’ s after -tax cash flows less any spending on either the maintenance or replacement of fixed assets, and in acquir- ing working capital. The free cash flow left over may be used either to pay down debt, pay dividends, buy back stock, for discretionary growth investments and more. The firm will (should) choose investments that further maxi- mize FCF . This discussion has, so far , assumed that we, financial ana- lysts, are perfectly capable of making accurate, numerical projections about matters that have not yet occurred. In reality , projections are virtually always going to be some- what incorrect – when all is said and done. Projections “under uncertainty” are beyond this manual’ s scope. This example is generic in the sense that it may represent either the view of an external analyst looking at a cor- poration’ s most recent financial report, and, based on the report, making an assessment of the corporation’ s growth prospects and equity investment merits based on its FCF; or it could be a projection that an internal analyst makes for a potential corporate investment project. Projecting F ree Cash Flow: Ex ercise #2 We have already projected net income and earnings per share (see above under the heading “Corporate Forecasting and Strategic Planning ”).We also understand the implica-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 218\\n\\ntions of depreciation , a non-cash expense, on income and cash. Now , we will conduct an exercise, based on the earlier net income and EPS projections, in which we shall create a pro-forma statement – of a sort – of free cash flows for mul- tiple future years rather than just one year ’s net income. The figures for EBIT and Depreciation were calculated and the solutions can be found in Section #8.6; these figures are needed for the FCF problem herewith. This spreadsheet will be useful when, later , we assess such cash flows in present value terms in order to make capital investment decisions. In this connection, take note that interest, for example, is excluded from FCF because it is a capital cost, as discussed earlier .In order to do this, we need to recall the FCF formula. Here, once again, it is: [(EBITDA )(1 – T) ]+[(Depr eciation )(T)]–[Necessary Capital Expenditur es]–[Increase in Net W orking Capital ] In our pro-forma ,Five-year income statement, we have many of the elements: EBIT , depreciation, and tax rate (i.e., 40%) . Let us assume the following for the missing parts: 1.For EBIT and Depreciation figures, use the data calculated earlier – in Section #8.6. 2.There is no amortization. 3.Replacement and maintenance capital expendi- tures shall be $1,000 in “Y ear 1” and grow thereafter at a 5% rate. 4.Current Assets will increase in Y ear 1 by $500 the first year , and each year thereafter at a219 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\ngrowth rate of 10%. 5.Current Liabilities will increase in Y ear 1 by $750 and each year thereafter at a growth rate of 5%. ◦(Hint: an increase in current liabilities is a source of funds.) ◦Take note that the differences are incremental. To make matters simple, a spreadsheet is provided below , which is consistent with the FCF formula. Notice the (hor- izontal) line breaks, which assist you in separating out the pieces of the formula from their respective sub-parts. Note also that cash outflows should be bracketed, since they are negative. Some of the information in the spreadsheet will be imported from the earlier net income exercise, while some will be derived from the set of four assumptions noted on the prior page.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 220\\n\\nUntil the day when G-d shall deign to reveal the futur e to man, all human wisdom is summed up in these two wor ds,‘Wait and hope.’ -Alexandre Dumas The Count of Monte Cristo221 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nProjecting F ree Cash Flow -Solution- (Exercise #2) Here is the solution: Introduction toFinancial Analysis 222\\n\\nA mensch tracht un Gott lacht.

It cannot achieve a sales increase (“growth”) without adding on productive “capital assets ”(not to mention maintaining existing assets) in order to produce more goods for sale . Some further internal funds will be gen- erated by accounts payable, also in the normal course of business conduct. Payables are, essentially , free, short-term loans provided by the firm’ s suppliers for , usually , 30 days. Payables are, finan- cially speaking, (interest-) free sources of funds. W e call these funds, including payables and retained earnings, by numerous names: “spontaneous, auto- matic,” or “internal.” Some of the com- pany’ s capital needs will be met “spontaneously ,” in the normal course of doing business by retaining some, or all, of its earnings. Such funds may be thought of as having been generated “internally .”Introduction toFinancial Analysis 224 224\\n\\nExternal FundsFor the balance of its capital require- ments, the corporation will need to go “outside ”the firm’ s normal venues – to bank lenders, and/or to bond and stock investors for its EFN orexternal require- ments. The extent to which t hecompany will use either debt orequity ,and in what proportions, is the subject of the “Capi- talStructure ”topic; this topic will be dis- cussed later . The EFN projection is an essential component toof the corpora- tion’s capital planning . The EFN Formula :The formula, which we shall develop, consists of three parts. The first part tells us how much additional assets the firm will require in order to support a stated sales growth objective. This part is based on the firm’ s required ratio of assets to sales. It will need more assets in order to produce more sales. We shall refer to this amount as the “gross requirement,” for lack of a better phrase. The next two parts indicate the extent to which first, accounts payable, and second, retained earnings may reduce the gross requirement. After having reduced the gross requirement by the two internally generated or spon- taneous sources of funds, we are left with a figure, which tells us how much additional, external financing the firm will have to arrange for itself in order to achieve its pre- set sales growth objective. External financing will take the form of new debt and/or equity . EFN Model’ s Restrictive Assumption : We shall assume that Financial Ratios remain the225 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nStatic Ratiossame over time, i.e., we will conduct “static analysis.” In practice, projections may not conform to past relationships precisely , for reasons known to, or assumed by ,the analyst. Here, for simplicity , we shall dispense with this complica- tion. In order to focus on the nature of the EFN formula – and not on dynamic financial ratio matters – we will assume, in the exercise to come, static ratios .“Sta- tic”means unchanging in time . The EFN F ormula – The Math Terminology : Funds –this refers to any and all financial resources that the firm may call upon, including cash, various forms of debt or borrowings, and equity , the latter two of which, like cash, also enable the firm to invest in any proposed corpo- rate investment project . Internal Funds – these may also be referred to as either “spontaneous” or “a utomatic .”These funds are automati- cally or spontaneously generated in the normal course of doing business. Anexample of this is accounts payable. When a producer orders raw materials ,a free loan for usually thirty days is created by the supplier . Over the course of the year , and as the thirty days continually “roll over” over the course of the entire year ,the producing firm is supplied with a free source of “internal” funds. The com- pany will also internally generate funds as it earns and retains a portion of its earnings – “retained earnings .”Introduction toFinancial Analysis 226\\n\\nExternal Funds –This refers to any “additional” funds the firm may need to raise beyond anyfunds that are generated in the normal course of doing business in order to finance a proposed corporate investment project. For external funds the firm will have to go, so to speak, outside the confines of its ordinary business by calling upon bank lenders, debt and equity investors, and possibly others. External funds are required to the extent that internal funds are insuf fi- cient. The EFN Formula : EFN= [(A 0/S0)ΔS] – [( AP0/S0)ΔS] – [(M 0) (S1) (RR0)] OR [(A0)(S1/S0–1)]– [(AP 0)(S1/S0–1)]– [(M0)(S1) (RR0)] EFN= Required increase in assets [(A0/S0)ΔS] Less: “spontaneous” increase in Liabilities [(AP 0/S0)ΔS] Less: “spontaneous” increase in Retained Earnings [(M0)(S1) (RR0)] Key:227 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 228\\n\\n9.5 Internal and External F unds (Summary) We said above that the firm may reduce its total require- ment for acquiring funds through the “spontaneous” or “automatic” generation of internal funds. Internal Funds : •Accounts Payable ◦If the firm bought supplies and raw or finished inventory etc. under “cash on delivery , or “COD,” terms of sale, it would have to pay for it – with cash! If it has enough cash, it will incur anopportunity costs , because the cash would not be invested. If it had to bor- row the money , it would incur an explicit borrowing cost at a rate of interest. However , most firms are pro- videdwith 30- day terms of sale from itssuppliers, which amounts to a 30-day free loan, during which time it incurs neither an opportunity –nor an explicit –cost. In this sense, credit terms – Accounts Payable – provide cash flow to the buying firm. The cor- poration receives a free loan, of a sort, from its suppliers. ◦Although the Accounts Payable will229 Kenneth S.Bigel 229\\n\\nbe paid in 30-days ,the firm will have on average over the course of the year,30-days of access to a free source of funds. The firm, more or less simultaneously , pays down the Payables and then re-orders more goods. •Addition stoRetained Earnings ◦This, clearly , provides a stream of internal funds to the corpora- tionasprofits aremade and retained . We also said that, to the extent that internal funding is insuf ficient to satisfy all the investment needs, it may seek additional funding externally . External Funds : •Short-term bank lines of credit •Short-term bank loans – “notes” •Long-term (bank) loans – “debt” •Issuance (sale) of corporate notes or bonds •Issuance (sale) ofequityIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 230\\n\\n9.6 The EFN F ormula Explained The EFN F ormula Explained You will observe that the EFN formula has three parts (sep- arated by two minus signs). EFN= [(A 0/S0)ΔS)] –[(AP0/S0)ΔS] –[(M0) (S1) (RR0)] The first part represents the required increase in total assets [(A0/S0)ΔS)]needed to sustain the projected sales increase. Last year , assets equal to A 0were required by the firm to sustain asales level equal to S 0.Hence, we formu- late the ratio A0/S0. Assuming this ratio remains static, next year , the firm will require so much more in assets ; this is arrived at by multiplying the ratio by ΔS, the projected sales increase ;ΔS = S 1– S0. However , some of this “gross requirement ”will be “spon- taneously ” or “automatically” met by the normal business generation of “internal ”funds in the manner of sponta- neous liabilities, by which we primarily refer to accounts payable (not notes payable o r the current portion of long- term debt payable). Last year , such internal funds repre- sented a certain percentage of sales: (A0/S0). If we multiply this dollar figure by the projected sales increase (ΔS), we may see to what extent spontaneous liabilities reduce the original “gross requirement. ” Finally , the firm will also – hopefully – generate and retain231 Kenneth S.Bigel 231\\n\\nsome of its earnings, thereby further reducing its “gross requirement .”If we take the firm ’s net profit mar gin(NI/S = M0)and multiply it by next year ’s sales (S1), we get next year’s projected net profits: ( M0) (S1)= NI 1.If we the net profit mar gin (i.e., M 0= NI/S) times next year ’s sales, we get next year ’snetprofits. I f we further multiply this by the firm’ s retention rate ( RR0), we get the firm’ s projected retained earnings. After all is said and done, we have a figure – the dollar amount of EFN – that enables the firm to plan for next year’s acquisition of external financing , and hence increased asset levels in support of the planned sales increase .Interesting ly, this formula does not instruct us relative to the extent to which the external requirement should be met by either debt or equity ,and in what Debt- to-Equity proportion. Note: For simplicity of presentation only ,below we will ignore the “rule” of using an average balance sheet datum when concocting mixed ratios ( i.e., those that include both bal- ance sheet and income statement data ).This simplifica- tionis in addition to the static analysis already assumed. Some useful formulae : •ΔS = S 1– S0 •M0= NI / S •RR = (NI – D) / NI = A.R.E. / NI = 1 – PRIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 232\\n\\n233 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n9.7 EFN Application EFN Application You are given the following income statement and balance sheet.

Answer : It means that, if my company wishes to grow its sales next year by $500, it will need to add on $250 worth of assets, of which $180.90 will be funded externally . Remember : If it wishes to increase assets by $250 in order to achieve its sales objective, it will have to increase the other side of the balance sheet by the same amount. In this case, $25 will be provided internally by accounts payable, $44.10 will be provided internally through retained earn- ings, and $180.90 will be provided externally by some mix of debt and equity .Introduction toFinancial Analysis 236 236\\n\\nNote 1: 1.Usespontaneous changes only , that is, AP for liabilities, exclude Notes Payable (NP) and Long-term debt (L TD). 2.This was based on a static ratio analysis – our restrictive assumption. 3.This has been an incremental analysis; we were only interested in the additional amount of funds needed, and that’ s what we got! Question #2: How much of the $180.90 will be externally funded by debt and how much by equity? Question #2, Answer 1: The present debt/equity ratio is 3:7, i.e., 30% debt and 70% equity . Total capital is $1,000, with $300 of debt and $700 of equity (D ÷ TA = 30%). Assuming static analysis, 30% of the $180.90 will be237 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nfinanced by debt and 70% by equity . This will maintain the capital ratios in the same proportions as prior to the new external fund- ing. Question #2, Answer 2: Another , perhaps better , way of calculating the debt ratio, for this purpose, would be by excluding internal capital from the figures. In this way , we would be establishing only how much external debt and external equity should be raised, an approach, which would be more consistent with the purpose of the EFN formula. We agreed that the firm needs $180.90 of external funds. Thus presently , external debt ÷ external equity = 200 ÷ 500; that is 28.5% (2/7) in debt as compared to the total of external capital. We had raised $2 of external debt for every $5 of external equity . Total external capital was $700 (5/7) (not the $1,000 in total capi- tal used in the prior calculation). In this alternate calculation, we have ignored internal accounts payable ($100) and retained earn- ings ($200). Incremental internal funds will be provided over the coming year as in the past. Below we illustrate both answers. Note 2:Introduction toFinancial Analysis 238\\n\\nIn the first two expressions in the EFN model, i.e., [(A0/S0) ΔS] and[(AP0/S0) ΔS], we utilize the incremental, projected sales increase (i.e., ΔS) whereas the third portion [ (M0) (S1)(1 – PR 0)], we utilize the entire projected sales amount (S 1). Why , in fact, may Financial Ratios change ? In the foregoing analysis, we assumed that financial ratios do not change over time. In fact, ratios are dynamic. Here are some reasons why , in fact, ratios will change. 1.Economies of scale – as companies grow lar ger and produce more, they benefit, according to Microeconomic theory , from lower production costs perunitproduced , even though total (production) costs are rising .The phenomenon will continue until the firm reaches full capacity and needs toadd on assets in order to continue growing. The Asset/Sales and Profit ratios will be af fected. Assets will remain flat as sales grow – until full capacity is reached . With unit costs down, gross profits will increase. 2.“Lumpy Assets” i.e., firms may reach a level where they have to acquire more (expensive) assets (assets don’ t grow smoothly or in the same propor- tion as the sales increase, which is likely smoother). For example, the factory may be at only 60% of capac-239 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nity, which af fords substantial growth in production and sales without adding on capacity or expanding to an addi- tional facility . Should sales continue to grow beyond present capacity , it would be incumbent upon the firm to add to its fixed assets at some point. Such assets would suddenly jump in size. Sales, by contrast, may grow rel- atively smoothly over time. The Sales/ Total Asset ratio will provide some insight. 3.Capital Costs (i.e., the economic costs to the corporation of borrowing money and issuing stock) will likely change over time – interest rates will go up and down, causing changes in the cost of debt, borrowed money . If the cost of debt decreases , after -tax income may increase. It will then be cheaper to finance new fixed assets, so the firm may then decide to add on more P , P, & E. The T .I.E. Ratio (EBIT / Interest Expense) may pro- vide some added insight here. Also, stock investors will demand that the company produce dividends and increased profits – to be retained if notIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 240\\n\\ndistributed as dividends. Additions to Retained Earnings will increase the company’ s value and hence its share price. (Capital Costs should not be confused with Capital Assets Costs.) In short, what investors require or demand, the corporation must provide; return to the investor is an economic costto the corporation.241 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n9.9 Summary: The F undamentals of Accounting and Financial Analysis This might be a good place to review what we have learned thus far . First, we highlighted some dif ficulties in reading financial statements fo rfinancial analysts. We did this by focusing on examples of current (inventory) and long-term asset accounting (depreciation) respectively .These high- lights assisted us in listing and understanding the four pri- mary issues related to accounting data interpretation namely , historical bias, the arbitrary use of cost method, and problems having to do with estimates and reserves. For us, the statements may not be what they seem ,with conse- quent reduced usefulness. If we are going to use accounting data as input sfor ratio analysis, wemust first and fore- most be cognizant of this, and (later) learn how toadjust the numbers, a skill, which you would acquire in aFinancial Statements Analysis course. Between highlighting accounting problems and presenting ratio analysis, we discussed the creation of pro forma financial statements and created a projected income state- ment. W e also looked at a model for projecting free cash flow, a very important predictor of a company’ s ongoing performance , and a metric by which possible investment projects are evaluated .Finally , we discussed the External Funds Needed model, an important tool in capital plan- ning in order to accommodate growth .Introduction toFinancial Analysis 242 242\\n\\n9.10 Chapters Eight & Nine: Review Questions Chapter s8 – 9 :Review Questions 1.Define each of the following terms: Incremen- talism, Sunk Costs, and Cannibalization. 2.In words, explain what is meant by Free Cash Flow . 3.Why is FCF important?

What are the futur e values (FVs) given each of the following ques- tions? In other words, how much money will you have at the relevant future points in time? (If you had more than $1, the answers would be the appropriate multi- ple thereof.) As we go through the questions and calcula- tions, observe how the outcomes, or solutions, change. T ry to explain the reasons for the dif- ferences in the out- comes. Also, observe that the seemingly small differences in outcomes are really not as trivial as may seem at first glance. W e are illustrating Future V alues, in each question, of just one dol- lar of money that we have now – of Present V alue. Sup- pose we were instead dealing with millions of dollars? As we go through each question, we will ,methodically and253 Kenneth S.Bigel 253\\n\\npainstakingly ,create ageneral symbolic formula, which may be employed for any similar problem. Insert the appropriate values into the formulae to solve the prob- lems numerically .(Solutions follow .) 1. You will earn 5% interest, paid once a year , at the END of the year , for one year . You have $1 now of Present V alue (PV). In one year , you will receive your “principal” of $1 back plus interest at an annual rate of return (R) of 5%. A gen- eral Future V alue (FV) formula will therefore be: FV = PV (1 + R) Insert the relevant data into the formula in order to solve for the Future V alue. As we go through this analysis, you will need tolearn and remember the symbols or abbreviations. 2. Same as question #1, but R = 10%. Here we will use the same formula as above, but you will insert a dif ferent rate for R. What is the Future Value? Why is the outcome dif ferent? 3. Same as question #2, i.e., R = 10%, but for two years (n years), rather than just one. We will now have two years of compound interest; n = 2. Therefore, we apply the FV formula, slightly modified, a second time: FV = PV (1 + R) (1 + R)Introduction toFinancial Analysis 254\\n\\nFV = PV (1 + R)n Here, the exponent, “n,” stands for the number of years in which the money compounds. Once again, i n this case, n = 2. What is the Future V alue? Why is the outcome dif ferent than in the prior question ? 4. 10% interest, twice a year , for one year . Interest is always quoted as anannual rate, unless explicitly noted otherwise. Our annual rate is still 10%, but we will receive halfof it, i.e., R ÷ p = 0.10 ÷ 2 = 0.05 ,at the endof each half-year . The letter , “p” stands for the number of compounding periods per year ;here p= 2. FV = PV (1 + R /p)(1 + R /p) Notice that, while n= 2, there are now two com- pounding periods per year , so the exponent must reflect that. Our exponent is therefore now: “ n × p. ” Whenever p ≠1, we must make twoadjustments to the formula: “R/p” in the rate part of the formula and “n × p” in the exponent. While in theory P can take on any integer value, it will actually be equal to 1, 2, 4, 12, or 365 for annually , semi-annually , quarterly , monthly , or daily respectively . (In this example, n = 1; when p = 1, we tend to leave it out as the power of one is implicit.) Our general formula now becomes: FV = PV (1 + R /p)n × p255 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nFactor Multiplier Exponen- tial Com- poundingOur Future V alue formula is now complete. What Future V alue do you get? Why is the outcome dif fer- ent than in question #2? Note that, when solving for Future Value, we multiply the Present Value by a “factor” of (1 + R/p)n × p.Afactor is simply a multiplier . This multiplicative and exponen- tialprocess is referred to as com- pounding . 5. Same as question #4, but for two years. We can employ the formula in the prior question. Remember , “p” occurs twice in our formula. Here, n = 2, and p = 2. What is your Future V alue? Why is the outcome dif ferent than in question #3? 6.What happens to future values as interest rates (“R”), the number of years (“n”), and compounding frequency (“p”) increase? In answer to this question, we present ,in sum- mary ,the “Three Commandments” of the T ime V alue of Money . The Thr ee Commandments of TVM Introduction toFinancial Analysis 256\\n\\nDiscount- ing ReciprocalOf course, t he opposite will occur if R, N, and/or P decline .Below , we explain Present V alues . 7.For each of the above questions, what would be the pre- sent value of $1 to be received at the end of the stated peri- ods? In other words, where in questions 1 though 5, we assumed $1 of PV and had to calculate its FV , we will now assume $1 of FV and calculated its PV using the data in each of the first 5 questions. Here, we will re-employ our Future V alue formula, but transpose the FV and PV num- bers so that we can solve for PV , rather than for FV . PV =FV÷(1 + R /p)n × p Thus, when solving for Present V alue wedivide the Future V alue by the (1 + R/ p) n × p factor . This division process is referred to as discounting . Rather than dividing, we can also multi- ply the Future V alue by the recipr ocal of the divisor . PV =FV× [1 ÷ (1 + R /p)n × p] Definition : Arecipr ocal is the inverse of a number , which is arrived at by turning the num- berupside down ! So, 1/2 or 0.5 is the reciprocal of 2. The reciprocal of 5 is1/5– or 20% .So, (1 + R/p)n × pand [1 ÷ (1 + R/p)n × p] are reciprocals of one another . In using Interest Rate T ables (soon) , which display ready-made , already-calcul atedfactors, you will note that all the factors ’ values are stated as multipli-257 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\ners, including the Present V alue Factors (PVFs). We will use tables in order to cut down on the number of calculations that we must make and to thereby reduce errors. 8.Isit a realistic question to ask what the PV is ?How might this actually occur ? Of course it is! W e will often know the future pay- ments and wish to figure out the PV s!For example, you may wish to put aside some money for the down payment on a house in “ n” years. Assuming you know the “discount rate, ”how much must you set aside today in order to fund that amount? How much will you need to set aside today to fund your new- born child’ s college tuition? A bond pays interest every six months in a known amount. How much should you pay today in order to receive those future amounts? Solutions and Explanations : The $1 in the question is referred to as Present V alue (PV). The amount of money we will have in the future is referred to as Future V alue (FV). Remember , we are, so far , assum- ing that the interest payments are made at the endof each relevant payment period.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 258\\n\\nAn investment in knowledge pays the best inter est. -Benjamin Franklin259 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 260\\n\\n10.3 Interest-on-the-Interest: The Nature of Compound Interest After one year (as noted in the example above), the investor will have earned $0.10 for every dollar invested at 10%. This was represented by the formula: $1 (1.10) = $1.10 . We noted that if the investor had invested for two years (again at 10% per year) hewould have $1.21. This was rep- resented by: $1 (1.10) 2= $1.21 .In other words, in the first year, s/he earned $0.10 in interest, while in the second year , he earned $0.1 1. Why does he earn more interest in the sec- ond year if the interest rate – 10% – remains the same? In the second year ,heonce again receives $0.10 interest on his principal investment of $1. However , since hehas already earned $0.10 of interest from the prior year ,hewill also earn 10% on that dime! That is equal to another penny of interest earned: ($0.10) (10%) = $0.01. Thus ,in the sec- ond year hewill have earned another $0.10 plus $0.1 1 or a total of $0.21. The following summarizes this notion:261 Kenneth S.Bigel 261\\n\\nThis is the nature of interest-on-the-interest: Compound Inter est! Each year , the interest-on-the-interest will con- tinue to compound.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 262\\n\\n10.4 Some More Simple TVM Problems What is my Futur e Value under the following scenarios? (After each solution, write out the equivalent mathemati- cal, symbolic notation.) Scenario 1 : Assume I have $1and I invest for one year , receiving an interest payment of .12 at the year ’s end. $1 (1.12) = ___________ Scenario 2 : What if I invest for two years, receiving an interest payment of .12 at the end of each year? $1 (1.12) (1.12) = $1 (1.12)2__________ Scenario 3 : What if Scenario 1 is changed to account for semi-annual compounding? $1 (1 + .12/2)1 x 2= __________ Scenario 4 : What if Scenario 2 is changed to account for semi-annual compounding? $1 (1 + .12/2)2 x 2= __________ •If I know the Future V alue of $1, how do I cal- culate the PV? Solve for each.263 Kenneth S.Bigel 263\\n\\nNote: Asking “what is the present value of some money to be received in the future, ”is equivalent to asking how much money is needed today in order to have a certain amount later, assuming a given investment rate. In other words, for a person to have one dollar five years from now ,i.e., FV , how much will s/he have to invest today at x%?

It is very easy to make mistakes in doing these calculations. For example, remember that the compounding frequency adjustment, “p,” occurs twice in the basic TVM formula; don’t for get to make the relevant adjustments here . Be methodical and go slowly .Introduction toFinancial Analysis 264\\n\\nIn the end, “eyeball” your solution. If it does not look right in terms of the TVM rules that we already know , it prob- ably is not! It will look correct if it seems to be consistent with the above-cited characteristics of TVM. So far , in all the foregoing examples, we have used $1 as present value. This makes it easy to learn and allows one to focus on the manner in which present and future val- ues multiply out. In reality of course, present values would be other , greater numbers, such as $1,237,874.32. All one need do is substitute in the relevant number where hereto- fore we had the lonely $1 value. Time is money . -Benjamin Franklin265 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n10.5 Simple F uture and Present V alues (Formulas) Having done the foregoing work, it is plain to see that we cansymbolically represent the mathematics using the fol- lowing “language.” Key: The expression, or “factor ,” (1 + R/p)n x p, may be used as a “multiplier” when compounding from present to future values and, in its reciprocal form, as a multiplier again when discounting from future to present value s. You will find the factors, calculated out, in interest rate tables, trun- cated versions of which you will find on the pages follow- ing.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 266 266\\n\\n“R/p” means that if the annual interest rate (R) is 12% and the number of compounding periods (p) is 12 (i.e., monthly compounding) the periodic compound rate is .12 ÷ 12 = .01. After one year , the FV would be $1 ( 1.01)12 = $1.1268. (Notice that this compares with once –a–year compoun ding at 12%: $1 (1.12) = $1.12. The dif ference in Future V alues is nottrivial.267 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n10.6 Compounding F requency Assumption Let’s examine the ef fect of changing the compounding (or discounting) frequency on both the Present- and Future- Values. Assume that we earn 10% for five years (R = 0.10; n= 5). Assume that we are given $1 of Present- and Future-V alues respectively . Notice how , as “P” increases, FVs increase ,and PVs decrease – bothat decreasing rates!Introduction toFinancial Analysis 268 268\\n\\nThe mathematics for continuous compounding and dis- counting follow on the next page. Y ou will note that the difference between daily and continuous compounding and discounting is very small. Today , we don’ t often – if ever – see instruments that exhibit continuous compounding.269 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n10.7 Simple F uture and Present V alues: Continuous Compounding (Supplemental) In order to solve for continuous compounding, we must engage the “rule of limits” or otherwise utilize the “natural log.” The natural logarithm is the logarithm to the base e, where eis equivalent to the irrational number 2.71828. The following presents an exemplary solution for continu- ous compounding. FV = PV (eRn) and PV = FV (e-Rn) Where, e = 2.71828 R = interest rate Note : P is omitted since the compounding is continuous ratherIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 270 270\\n\\nthan periodic. Example : PV = $1 R = .09 N = 10 years FV = ? Solution : FV = ($1) (2.71828(.09) (10)) = $2.4596271 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n10.8 Char acteristics of the Time V alue of Mone y: FV and PV The following summarizes and reviews some key char- acteristics of the Time V alue of Money about which we already learned. •As the interest rate increases, Futur eValue also increases. •As the number of years (n), periods per year (p), or total periods (n × p) increases, the Futur e Value increases. •As the compounding frequency per year increases, the Futur eValue increases. •Restate each of the above statements for Present Values. •FV and PV factors – or multipliers – are recipro- cals of one another . You will find below a partial interest rate table. If you use such tables properly , you will be able to locate the correct multipliers – or “factors” – for a given situation. Y ou will note that the PV factors are expressed as the reciprocals of their corresponding FVs . In order to arrive at the FV or PV of a specified dollar amount, one need only choose the cor- rect cell and multiply the specific dollar amount by the fac- tor. For example, the FV of $1 at 5% for ten years is $1 ×Introduction toFinancial Analysis 272 272\\n\\n1.6289. The PV for 10% compounded semi-annually for five years is $1 × .6139. In cases where we have more than one compounding or discounting period per year , we would need to make the same adjustments that were made mathematically earlier . For example, the multiplier for 10% and 5 years semi- annually would be found under the 5% column and 10-period row . “Period” in the tables would be equivalent to “n × p” in our , more mathematical, nomenclature. 273 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n10.9 F uture and Present V alue Factors (Multipliers) Here is another look at a somewhat less abbreviated inter- est rate table. Assume that we are given $1 of Present- and Future-V alues re spectively .(Fill in the empty 15% col- umn by hand and compare your answers to the factors in the published tables; see thelink to Interest Rate T ables below .)Note that, in using tables, “Periods” = n × p. Futur e Value Factors Formula: FV = PV (1 + R/ p)n×p Present V alue Factors Formula: PV = FV ÷ (1 + R/p)n×pIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 274 274\\n\\nHere are some interest rate tables for you to use: http://www .retailinvestor .org/pdf/futurevaluetables.pdf275 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n10.10 A W ord on Compounding Frequency and Annual Equivalent Rates Questions: 1.What is the dif ference between 10% annual rate, compounded annually versus a 10% annual rate, compounded quarter - in terms of FV of $1? 2.How may the two rates be equated? In other words, how may I define the annual frequency at a rate equivalent to the quarterly frequency? 3.What happens as the compounding frequency increases? Solution to Question #2 : In general, (1 + R/ p)np= FV Annually , (1.10)1=1.10 versusIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 276 276\\n\\nQuarterly , (1 + .10/4)1 x 4= (1.025)4= 1.1038 That is, 10% quarterly is equivalent to 10.38% annu- ally! In other words, the Annual Percentage Rate ( APR ) for 10% compounded quarterly , is 10.38%!277 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n10.11 Interpolation What if we have a fractional compound or discount rate – such as 9.5% – which is not to be found in published tables ? Can we still use the tables? Or do we need to solve the problem mathematically (or by financial calculator)? One way to get around this is by estimating the multiplier by means of averaging the two whole multipliers that bracket the fractional one in question. W e call this process “interpolation” because we insert the average number in between the relevant values or factors, which are stated in the table. Let’ s use the future value table below to illustrate this. Futur e Value Factors What is the appropriate, estimated future value multiplier for 10 years at 9.5%? This can be approximated by taking the simple average of the multipliers for 9% and 10%: (2.3674 + 2.5937) ÷ 2 = 2.4806 This is only an estimate. Remember that time value factors increase (in this case – or decrease in the case of present values) at an exponential rate. The true mathematical future value for 9.5% for 10 years is:Introduction toFinancial Analysis 278 278\\n\\n1.09510= 2.4782 This differs from the simple average estimate, of 2.4806 – 2.4782 = 0.002. W e first note that the simple average pro- duces a higher number than the true, exponential figure; this is notable. This is as expected because, in dealing with future value factors, the numbers grow exponentially or more quickly , and thus we would start of f with a lower number . Put dif ferently , we do not grow from 9% to 10% at a linear rate, but at an increasing, curvilinear rate.279 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n10.12 Interpolation Illustr ated Interpolation may be useful in order to estimate future (and present-) values when one does not wish, or have the abil- ity, to calculate more precise measures. The reason for the error has to do with the curvilinear relationship between (discount- and) compound interest rates and their related multipliers. This is best seen by illustration. One may readily see that, by connecting the asterisks, the interpolated value of 2.4806 resides on a straight line between the correctly calculated future value multipliers for 9% and 10% respectively . However , the time value of money is not linear . Any time an exponent is involved, you will not get a linear rela- tionship, but a curvilinear outcome of some sort. Hence, the correct multiplier for 9.5% is 2.4782, which is lowerIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 280 280\\n\\nthan the interpolated arithmetic average of 2.4806. If one joins the asterisks for 9% and 10% to the mathematically calculated middle value of 2.4782 (represented by “#”), one readily observes the curvilinear relationship between compound interest rates and their respective multipliers. In short, as rates increase, future values increase in non-linear fashion. Correspondingly , present values would decrease non-linearly . The non-linear nature of these curves will soon be discussed in greater depth when we get to “V olatil- ity.” Basic mathematical examples will be presented.281 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n10.13 Some TVM Pr actice Questions You will need to solve all these problems by hand. You will not be able to use the tables. 1.You are given the following .Investment = $2,800, Rate = 0.54%, P = quarterly ,N = 8 years. What is the Future V alue? 2.You are give ntwo choices: 1.invest at an annual rate of 10% compounded monthly ,or2. at 10.1% compounded semi-annually . Which willyou prefer? 3.Bonus question :You will receive $24,000, $29,500, $58,000 and $87,000 each year con- secutively for the next four years.

Interestingly , it is also true that $173,262.78 ×1.046 (to the fourth) = $207,41 1.11. If you had already calculated the Present V alue of this uneven series of cash flows, you would not have had to go through the long calculation of the Future V alue. (If you have trouble with this, it’ s OK. W e will get to Uneven Cash Flow series soon. Y ou can come back to it later.)283 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n10.14 The V olatility of the Time V alue of Mone y Discrepancies in TVM factors will widen as time increases, as one observes the relative factors between interest rate columns. For example, a five-year IOU with a future value of $1,000, using the tables, would have a present value of $1,000 (0.7835) = $783.50 – at a discount rate of 5%. The IOU could be purchased or sold for that amount, or price. Think of present value as an item’ s dollar price. If the discount rate instead were 10%, the present value would be only: $1,000 (0.6209) = $620.90. In percentage terms, the pre- sent value of $1,000 to be received five years from now , discounted at a rate of 5% is greater than at 10% by a dif- ference of (783.5 ÷ 620.9) – 1 = 26.2%. If however the IOU had a 30-year term, the dif ference in present value would itself compound. At 5%, the present value would equal $1,000 (0.2314) = $231.40. At 10%, the PV would equal $1,000 (0.0573) = $57.30. In percent- age terms, the present value of $1,000 to be received thirty years from now , discounted at a rate of 5% is greater than at 10% by a dif ference of (231.4 ÷ 57.30) – 1 = 303.8% .Introduction toFinancial Analysis 284 284\\n\\nKey Terms: Geometry5% 10%Percentage Differ ence 5% over 10% 5 Years 0.7835 0.6209 (783.5 ÷ 620.9) – 1 = 26% 30 Years 0.2314 0.0573 (231.4 ÷ 57.30) – 1 = 303% This demonstrates the volatility and geometry of TVM! By geometry here we refer to its non-linear and exponential nature. Whenever there is an exponent in aformula, we get some kind of curve . As time increases, dif ferences in present- and future-values for a given number of years themselves increase non-linearly . If you had purchased a thirty-year IOU as an investment, any changes in interest rates (i.e., due to market conditions) would have a far greater impact on the value of your IOU investment than if you had, instead, purchased a five-year obligation. For a given change in discount rates of interest, the impact on the multipliers is greater the greater the time is. The impact on price, which is present value, is greater , the greater the time–period . “Price volatility ,” so to speak, increases as the future payment grows more distant. Again, this is because, the time value of money is non-lin- ear; it is exponential. W e are dealing, quite literally , with compound interest, i.e., interest on the interest.

While this case is exaggerated, the bond market works in similar fashion. Bond pr ices can, at times, be quite volatile due to changes in market rates although lar ge changes do not occur instantaneously) except in the case of a disaster). Remember :prices are the present values of a bond’ s future payments !

In our example, the rate of changes in present value factors increased in time, e.g., from 26%, to 101%, to 303%. •However , the rate of increase is decreasing (i.e., “deceleration” or second derivative), e.g., from 126%, to 71%, to 38%. •In Calculus, we would say here that the first derivative is positive while the second derivative is negative. If we think of the price of the cash flows as distance covered as a function of time (“speed”), then we can think of the “First Deriv- ative.” W e can think of the “Second Derivative” here as the change in the rate of speed (“deceler- ation”) W ere the second derivative positive, we would be speaking of “acceleration.” W e observe these characteristics in this diagram:289 Kenneth S.Bigel 289\\n\\nImagine a payment due in the future; its present value would be determined by its rate – a short-term rate (and PVF!) for a short-term payment and so on . The r ate of change in present value wa s noted in the first derivative column, while the “rate of change in the rate of change ”in the present value wa s noted in the second derivative col- umn. In other words, as time increases, the dif ferences in present values – for 5% versus 10% – increase, but the rate of increase decreases!

If a series of cash flows may be defined as an annuity ,we will employ an Annuity T able tofigure the series’ FV/PV . In investments, most (if not all) annuities may be qualified as “Ordinary Annuities,” since their cash flows occur at theendof the relevant periods. Other annuities are called “Annuities Due,” meaning that the CFs occur at the start of the relevant period s. If,asin most cases, the cash flows do not qualify as an annuity , then their FV/PV smay be derived only by calcu- lating the FV/PV of each discrete CF and then aggregat- ing. This is the same process by which we shall derive the “short-cut” Annuity TVM factors.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 296 296\\n\\n11.3 The Derivation of ( Ordinary) Annuity Factors You are given the following information. Column by col- umn, complete the table by filling in the appropriate future value factors (FVF), the future values of each respective cash flow (FVCF), as well as the same for the present value factors and cash flows (PVF and PVCF). Once completed, add up the columns at the bottom. Note that here we are dealing with “ordinary” annuities, which means that all the cash flows in the series are received at the endof the relevant period. Soon, we will examine another convention. Use the timeline below to properly place each of the three cash flows temporarily (see the timeline below). Placement will determine the proper exponents and hence periods.

Note that if you had an interest rate table for annuities, you would be able to multiply the annuity cash flow (in this case, $100) by the appropriate factor . You would then arrive at the future- or present-values of the cash flows, in one step. Such annuity interest tables exist ; a link is provided at the bottom of this page. What may we observe from this table? Future value annu- ity factors are always greater than the number of periods. Here the FVF was 3.31, or greater than n · p = 3 periods. This is because the annuity multiplier is the sum of each respective yearly factor , each of which is greater than 1.0 (except the last one, which = 1.0) since they are all multi- ples of (1 + R)n. (This assumes that R > 0.) Contrarily , each PVF is less than the number of periods because the respective factors are all less than 1.0, as each factor is the reciprocal of (1 + R)n. (Again, this assumes that R > 0.)

The present value of the annuity is $248.68. If you, alter- natively , had had a single sum in the amount of $248.68, and had invested it for three years at 10%, you would have $331 at the horizon: ($248.68) (1.10)3= $331 and $331 ÷ (1.10)3= $248.68 Here are some more simple- and annuity- interest rate tables for you to use: http://www .cengage.com/resource_uploads/downloads/ 0324406088_41656.pdfIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 300\\n\\n11.5 F uture and Present Annuity Values: The Nature of Their Cash Flows Note the dif ferences in the nature of compounding versus discounting of annuity cash flows. Let’ s assume that the Cash Flows are to be received at the end of the respective periods. In the examples following, there are five cash flows. Compounding : There are, altogether , four compounding “periods”; the last cash flow to be received is not compounded because it is received at the “horizon” of the deal. Indeed, the last CF does have a zero-exponent attached to it: [1 + R]0= 1. The exponents are zero through four . Discounting : In contrast, there are five discounting periods. The expo- nents are one through five. Note that the arrows go in the opposite direction from before as we are now discounting to present values rather than compounding to future values.301 Kenneth S.Bigel 301\\n\\nWhile Simple Future and Present V alues factors (as observed by the relevant tables earlier) are reciprocals, or mirror images of one another , annuities are not.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 302\\n\\n11.6 F uture and Present Annuity Factors: Mathematical F ormulas Let’s “put on the table” the formal mathematical formulas for ordinary annuities’ factors. Remember: a “factor” is a multiplier (for the given cash flows). These formulae will be useful when your tables do not have a particular inter- est rate that you need, and especially when you need to calculate a fractional rate, e.g., 10.23%.

The reciprocal of a sum is not equal to the sum of reciprocals.305 Kenneth S.Bigel 305\\n\\nThe answers to the fill-ins above are: •The FV AF must always be – greater – than the number of compounding periods. •The PV AF must always be – less– than the number of discounting periods. Notes : 1.Over 30 years, an investor w hohasinvested $100 per year at 10% will have put down $100 ×30 = $3,000 in nominal terms. T he FV of the $100 annuity at 10% in comparison will be $100 ×164.49 = $16,449 2.Notice how quickly both the present and future value annuity factors increase. That is because we are constantly adding additional cash flows each year . That is also why the PV AFs increase , in contrast to the simple PV factors, which, of course, may only decrease – as per our three commandments – as time increases.

To illustrate, we will use the example – and chart – from above. Since the timing of the cash flows is dif ferent than in an ordinary annuity , the factors (and exponents) are also dif ferent. As you fill in the factors and the dollar amounts, draw the appropriate time- line. Question : What would be the PV and FV for the $100 three-year annuity at 10%? TimelineIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 310 310\\n\\nQuestions: 1.Notice that both PV and FV annuity due factors (and dollars therefore) are lar ger than the respective ordinary annuity factors. 2.The PV of an annuity due is equal to the PV of an ordinary annuity multiplied by one plus the discount rate (1 + R/P)1for one period. 3.The FV of an annuity due is equal to the FV of an ordinary annuity multiplied by the com- pound rate for one period. Show this mathe- matically .311 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n11.10 Annuities Due (Solutions) Question : What would be the PV and FV for a$100 three- year annuity due at 10%? Note : The PV and FV for an ordinary annuity with the same term (time) , rate of interest, and dollar amounts, were calculated at $248.68 and $331 respectively . Since an annuity due pro- vides each of its cash flows one period earlier than the ordi- nary annuity , the PV and FV of the annuity areboth equal to the ordinary annuity multiplied by (1 +R/p)1. In this case, that would be: $248.68 (1.10)1= $273.55 $331.00 (1.10)1= $364.10Introduction toFinancial Analysis 312 312\\n\\nDue to the fact that the cash flows come in sooner there are both more compounding periods and fewer discounting periods. The fewer number of periods leads to more com- pounding and less discounting, hence greater future- and present-values. This is handy to know because most interest rate tables pro- vide ordinary annuities factors, but not annuities due.313 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n11.11 Adjustment from Ordinary Annuity to Annuity Due The PV and FV for an ordinary annuity with the same term, rate of interest, and dollar amounts, were calculated earlier at $248.68 and $331 respectively . (See the table at the bot- tom of this page for a key summary of the dif ferences in exponents.) Since an annuity due provides each of its cash flows one period earlier than the ordinary annuity , the PV and FV of the annuity is equal to the respective ordinary annuity factors multiplied by (1 +R/p)1. (Note that in all instances the exponent is one because the cash flows are pulled ahead just one period.) In this case that would be: $248.68 (1.10)1= $273.55 $331.00 (1.10)1= $364.10 The fact that the cash flows are received (or paid) sooner in the example of an annuity due has an interesting impli- cation (as noted in the adjustment formula above). In the case of the PV , there will be fewer discounting periods than with an ordinary annuity , so the PV will be higher . In the case of the FV , there will be more compounding periods, hence the FV is also higher . Again, in both instances, the ordinary annuity factor is adjusted by a multiple of (1 +R/ p)1. Note that even when p ≠ 1, the exponent will always be one, representing just the one period (even if part of a year) in which the series is “pulled ahead.” Question : How would the adjustment in our example beIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 314 314\\n\\nmade if the compounding frequency instead were semi- annual? Answer : In this case, one would multiply by (1 +R/p)1= (1 + 0.10 / 2)1= (1.05)1. 315 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n11.12 Une ven Cash Flows Not all cash flows series are as neat as annuities. Using the TVM T ables, calculate both the PV and FV for the series of Uneven Cash Flows presented below . Assume a periodic discount/compound rate of 6%. The method by which this exercise will be done is the same as that which was done for deriving ordinary annuity fac- tors earlier – except that the cash flows here are uneven (or unequal) rather than all the same. While we have already done a similar exercise earlier , well, you know , practice makes perfect!

Next, mul- tiply each cash flow horizontally by the appropriate PVF . Aggregate. In order to complete the FVF column, start at the bottom- most cell and fill in 1.00; in the next cell up, fill in 1.06. As you go up, continue multiplying by 1.06. Remember , the arrows in the FV timeline are pointed in the other direction. Take note of the fact that the PV of the series is less than its nominal value and that the FV is greater . You will also317 Kenneth S.Bigel 317\\n\\nnote that, if you know the PV of the uneven series, you can simply multiply it by (1 + Rn)in order to arrive at the FV of the series. W ow!

We cannot evaluate its FV since it would beinfinite , as would be its nominal value. However , we canfigure the PV . The PV of a perpetuity is simply the (fixed) payment divided by the interest rate. For example, if the cash flows are $100 and the discount rate is 10%, the PV would be: PV = $100 ÷ .10 = $1,000 The general formula would thus be: PV = CF ÷ i This works because of the mathematical “law of limits. ” Simply put, as the cash flows grow more distant, the respective PVs of these cash flows approach zero. Adding increasingly distant cash flows will have an infinitesi- malimpact on the outcome, the present value. Thus, theIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 324 324\\n\\nsum can be calculated as mention ed. Let us examine this further . For example, a $100 annuity for five years at 10% has a PV of $379.08. A ten-year annuity has a PV of $614.46. An annuity of 25 years has a PV of $907.70 and a 50-year annuity would be $991.48. As time goes on, the PV of each additional year ’s cash flow becomes very , very small (i.e., time increases, PV decreases) so that adding such infinites- imal amounts provides no material addition to the aggre- gate. In the end, you will note that the above present values, when aggregated, will eventually approach, and theoreti- cally equal $1,000. This formula is applicable to preferred stock whose divi- dends ad infinitum are fixed.325 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n11.19 The “La w of Limits” and Perpetuities We have already seen that present value of a perpetuity can be described by the formula: P 0= CF ÷ i. W e have also provided both the algebraic derivation of this formula and a discussion as to how the present value of a perpetu- ity approaches (but never quite reaches) the price described by the formula. Still, many students find the idea of limits – and of the infinitesimal – dif ficult to grasp. Our intent here is to fur- ther elucidate the notion that present values decrease over time with the result that distant cash flows become so small, so infinitesimal – they have so many decimal places – that they add virtually nothing to the aggregate present value. In making this observation, you will also note that, as a result, the cumulative value of the perpetuity’ s present value approaches the theoretical price described by the for- mula, as posited by mathematicians. This is as it should be. Let us say that a perpetuity’ s cash flows are $1 and the interest rate at which we shall discount the series is 10%. The present value therefore would be: P 0= $1 ÷ .10 = $10. This is confirmed in the table below .Introduction toFinancial Analysis 326 326\\n\\nAfter 25 years, we reach 90% of the aforecited aggregate present value, and by the 50t hyear, we exceed 99% of the $10 value. W ith the passage of more time, we shall get closer and closer to $10 , but only reach $10 in infinite space .

If, in the last period, we received a cash flow of $100 and its growth rate is 5%, the next cash flow would follow this formula: (Last Cash flow: CF 0) (1 + g) = Cash flow in next period (CF 1). “G” represents a constant rate of growth in the cash flow over time. CF1= CF 0(1 + g) $105 = $100 (1.05) The formula for a growth-perpetuity is: (Cash flow next period ) ÷ (Discount rate – Growth rate). Symbolically , this may be expressed as: PV = CF 1÷ (r– g) In the above example ( where r= 0.10 ), if the growth rate had been 5%, the present value would be (assuming here that the next CF is $105, that is, [$100] [1.05] = $105): $105 ÷ (.10 –.05) = $2,100 Notice that for this formula to work, “ g” cannot equal or exceed “ r.” Mathematically , ifgexceeds rwe would get a negative denominator , resulting in a negative present value, which makes no sense. A mathematical rationale, while329 Kenneth S.Bigel 329\\n\\nKey Terms: Negative Growthnecessary , is however not suf ficient to justify this relation- ship. There must be a financial explanation. One, theoretically ,earns some positive return – “ r”–for investing in a no-risk asset1 ;otherwise ,no one would invest at all. Even with no risk (and no growth!) , there is a positive return. Therefore r>g.Asgrowth rates increase (in linear manner) , so too does risk; higher growth rates are more dif ficult to achieve and hence are riskier .R(“r”) should exceed g, as a practical, non-mathematical matter . This is depicted in the diagram below . This formula may also come in handy for cases of negative gr owth . Since “ g” would be negative, in this case, the for- mula would require that one add the growth rate to the interest rate in order to determine the present value. Suppose the last cash flow (CF0) was $100 , there is a nominal cash flow growth rate of negative 5%,and a discount rate of 10%. What would the present value be? 1.As this is being written (2021), we observe an unusual environment wherein interest rates in many parts of the world are negative.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 330\\n\\n[($100) (1 – (0.05)] ÷ [.10 – (-.05)] = $95 ÷ .15 = $633.34 Of course ,the PV in the case of positive growth far exceeds the outcome we observed with negative growth. Is that not as it should be? This formula is applicable to common stock, whose divi- dends may grow – positively or negatively . Note : Looking at this graph alone one may conclude that, at some point, r<g. This is because the line is steeper than at a hor- izontal plane, thus, there would be less “rise” than “run,” leading eventually to growth exceeding the discount rate, and producing a negative present value. While this may be true if one limits the analysis to the graph alone, it cannot be correct ,in fact ,that dividend growth is not reflected in return – which is also the discount rate , and part of the denominator . As dividends rise, so too must return. (Remember: discounting and compounding are the same; just the arrows go in dif ferent directions.) This anomalous and paradoxical case will be discussed in depth when we discuss the “Dividend Discount Model.”331 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n11.21 F ractional Time P eriods So far , we have dealt only with whole periods and, there- fore, whole exponents. T rue, you may ar gue that we have also broken whole periods into halves (or other pieces), such as (whole period) half years, so that, for example, an annual rate of 10% compounded / discounted semi-annu- ally became 5% per period; exponents were still whole numbers. But let’ s not stop here! Occasionally , cash flows may occur before the end of a period. Suppose you earn 10% per year , compounded daily . What would be the FV after ¾ of a year? If we assume a 360-day year13, ¾×360 = 270 days. (In short-term financial analysis, we often deal with, or oth- erwise assume, twelve 30-day months to a year .) Further , 10% ÷360 = .0002777. Therefore, after 270 days, you will have earned: $1 (1 + .10/360)270= $1 (1.0002777)270= 1.077850 By comparison, if the compounding period is three months or aquarter ofa year ,then: 1 (1 + .10/4)3= 1.0769 If, in fact, the compounding period is a whole year , then we may employ a fractional exponent:Introduction toFinancial Analysis 332 332\\n\\n1 (1.10)3/4= 1.0741 All of the foregoing choices are arithmetically correct. The compounding convention you use matters. In practice, you will have to know the proper convention commonly used in each situation. Here are some more examples. Notice that if we calculate the FV of $1 at 10% annually , after half a year we would have arrived at an FV of $1.05 ($1 (1 + .10/ 2)1) – as we may have assumed until now . However , if we use fractional exponents, we get a slightly dif ferent result: $1 (1.10)1/2= $1.048809 $1 (1 + .10/2)1P ≠ $1 (1.10)1/2 It is therefore very important to understand the context of the problem and the use of the appropriate compounding/ discounting convention. The T ake-away : Compounding assumptions matter . Be sure you use the correct assumptions.333 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n11.22 L oans: The Con ventional Mortgage Mortgages are dif ferent from ordinary loans. W ithmost loans, interest is paid over the term ,or life ,of the loan, and the entire principal is paid in one fell swoop at the loan’ s term,or maturity .In contrast, mortgages are self-amortiz- ing, which means that all payments include portions of both interest and principal, resulting in decreasing princi- pal balances over time until, at maturity , the entire loan will have been paid of f. Let us see, by way of (an unrealistic) example how this may work. Given: Principal: $100,000 Rate: 9 % Term: 10 Years Period: Yearly Mathematical Rationale : The loan proceeds, i.e., $100,000 in this case, represent the present value. The “periodic payment” represents the annu- ity payments to be made over future years and will include both Interest and Amortization .Amortization goes toward the reduction of the loan or principal balance. The present value of the annuity payments should equal the loan prin- cipal : Principal = Periodic Payment x Present V alue Annuity FactorIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 334 334\\n\\nCalculation : Payment = Principal ÷ PV Annuity Factor = $ 100,000 ÷ 6.42 = $ 15,576.32 Interest = Opening Balance × Rate Amortization = Annuity Payment less Interest Balance = Opening Balance less Amortization Payment and Amortization Schedule : In the first year , the interest portion of the payment is 9% of $100,000 or $9,000. This leaves $15,576 less $9,000 = $6,576 going toward amortization . The new ,amortized balance is hence $100,000 less $6,576 = $93,424. Each year the annuity installment is first used to pay the interest on the loan and the balance i sused to reduce the capi tal outstanding .This continues for each period until maturity . In the maturity year the last annuity installment is suf ficient to cover the interest still owed and the remaining balance. (You will note a round ednumber in the last year .)335 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nNote : Mortgage payments are usually made in MONTHL Y installments, and often with greater maturities. Mortgages in the USA today are at least 15 years in term and usually up to 30 years. Rates as of this writing are also substantially lower than illustrated. This has been simplified for illustra- tion purposes, so that the reader may easily refer to stan- dard interest rate tables.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 336\\n\\n11.23 A F ew Thoughts about Mortgages There are a few key points regarding mortgages, which require summary and notice. 1.Interest payments are tax deductible. Tax deductibility is important simply because it reduces the after -tax cost of the mortgage. Funds that would otherwise have gone to pay tax instead go to debt service. This benefit is reduced as the interest portion of the mortgage payment is reduced with time. 2.Partway through the loan, half the loan will have been paid of f. A mortgage has a kind of “half- life.” In the foregoing example, half the loan will have been paid of f after six years. This half- lifewill be greater than half the length of the mortgage because initially the annuity payments are used mainly to pay interest on the loan! 3.Total interest paid may be much greater than and in longer -term cases, a multiple of the principal – this can be calculated by evaluating the total payments minus the principal. In the foregoing example, over the ten years the borrower will have paid a total of 10 annual payments of $15,576.32 for a total of $155,763.20. If you subtract from this figure theloan principal of $100,000, you are left with a figure of337 Kenneth S.Bigel 337\\n\\n$55,763.20, which represents the total amount of interest paid over the life of the mortgage (unadjusted for time value). In other words, interest paid represents an addi- tional 55% approximately of the principal borrowed. (W e take note again that most mortgages require monthly pay- ments and that, in today’ s marketplace, most mortgages are 15to 30 years. ) Let us compare 15- and 30-year mortgages in terms of the ratio of interest payments made relative to theprincipal. We remind ourselves that in the above instance (10 years and 9%) we had 55% interest payments relative to the loan principal. Let us use $100,000 ofprincipal again, and, this time, 6% in interest. W e shall again employ the formula: Principal ÷ PV Annuity Factor = Periodic Payment 15 years :($100,000) ÷ (9.7122) = $10,296.33 Over 15 years total payments will equal (15) ($10,296.33) = $154,444.95. In this case, interest payments will equal 54.44% of the principal. 30 years :($100,000) ÷ (13.7648) = $7,264.91 Over 30 years, total payments will equal (30) ($7,264.91) = $217,947.30. In this case, interest payments will equal 117.95% of the principal. Even though the annual payments are less in the 30-year case, we see that interest payments multiply enormously over time.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 338\\n\\n11.24 Summary Comparison of 15- and 30-Year Mortgages The following table presents a comparison of the $100,000 annual pay mortgage (above) at 6% interest for 15- and 30-years. Notes and Questions : •The shorter -term mortgage presents a higher periodic payment requirement but entails less overall interest payments over time. •The longer -term mortgage presents a much higher total interest payment requirement but requires a lower periodic outlay . •Question :Under what conditions does it pay to take out the shorter -term mortgage? •Answer : It pays if the mortgagee has suf ficient cash flow , and wishes to minimize total pay-339 Kenneth S.Bigel 339\\n\\nments, especially interest, over time. •Question :Under what conditions does it pay to take out the longer -term mortgage? •Answer : It pays if one does not have suf ficient cash flow , is unwilling to settle for a less-costly home, and is relatively unconcerned about the long-term, lar ger amount to be paid; perhaps he does not intend to stay for the full thirty years. •In most circumstances, a 15-year mortgage will bear a lower rate than a 30-year mortgage – unlike this illustration. Here we focused on a single variable – time – which greatly impacts the scenario depicted relative to the minimal impact that a small premium interest rate would have for the increased term to maturity . •Taxation will also have an ef fect. Recall that interest payments on mortgages are, under cur- rent law , tax-deductible. The mortgage formula is important to master as it will be used again in three additional contexts: 1. Leasing; 2. Bond Accounting; and 3.Capital Budgeting: The Annual Annu- ity Approach.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 340\\n\\nMortgages in the New Millennium Innovation has br ought about a multitude of new products, such as sub-prime loans and niche cr edit programs for immigrants… Unquestionably , innova- tion and der egulation have vastly expanded cr edit availability to virtually all income classes.

It is cen- tral to all of financial analysis and must be mastered. It is a basic tool. In th e prior two chapters , we developed a rationale for assessing “simple” future- and present-values. W e defined the two qualifications for a cash flow series’ being cate- gorized as an annuity , and then defined an ordinary annu- ity as the sum of the series’ present- and future-values. W e further defined “annuities due” and outlined a means for converting an ordinary annuity into an annuity due. Addi- tionally , we determined how interest rate tables may be used as a shortcut tool for calculating thetime value of money . Then we assessed uneven cash flow series that do not qual- ify as annuities. W e examined two cases of perpetuities (no-growth and growth) as a special case of annuity . We examined fractional time periods and discovered the arbi- trary nature of certain time value calculations, which have to do with the varying conventions regarding the definition of “period” and the use of interest rates in this regard. Finally , an illustration of a mortgage was presented and evaluated. “Before one continues further in this text, it is imperative345 Kenneth S.Bigel 345\\n\\nthat the student master fully the critical concept of time value of money in all its variety .”Introduction toFinancial Analysis 346\\n\\n11.27 Chapters 10 - 11: Re view Questions 1.You are given $2.30 in the present.

The two principal components of return are income and profit, i.e., sales or “exit” price less investment cost . Income is com- mon to many assets including bonds (interest) , stocks (div- idends) , and real estate (rent) . The exit price may be equal to, greater or less than the asset’ soriginal investment cost , hence “profit” is included in return . Example : •Stock/bond/real estate cost or investment (C) = $1,000. This is an “outflow .” •Income (I) received over the course of the hold- ing period = $100. •Sales (exit) price (P) = $1,050. •The income and sales price are “inflows.” Holding Period Return (HPR) : HPR = inflows ÷ outflows -1 = [(I + P) / C] – 1353 Kenneth S.Bigel 353\\n\\nHPR = [(100 + 1,050) / 1,000] – 1 = + 15% Alternatively , we could have calculated the HPR by focus- ing only on the profit ( “Π”), in which case, we would have left out the “-1” expression at the end. Note that the profit = $1.050 – $1,000 = $50. The result is the same this way as depicted below . HPR = [(I + Π) / C] HPR = [(100 + 50) / 1,000] = + 15% Note : In either application, this is a “raw” calculation in that it does not account for the time value of money . This approach ignores the length of the holding period and the timing of the cash flows. Clearly one would rather earn the raw 15% return over a shorter period than longer . Would you rather 15% over one year or ten? A dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar earned tomorrow . While the HPR has severe conceptual limits, it provides key information upon which a better model may be con- structed. In this section, we will present the calculation for dollar price and return of a bond.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 354\\n\\nWhen you make a sale to your fellow…do not vic- timize one another . -Leviticus 25:1 And when you transact a pur chase to your friend, or acquir e from the hand of your friend, you shall not defraud one another . -Leviticus 25:14355 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n12.3 V aluation Premise So, the HPR is not acceptable because it does not include the critical notion of time value of money . In general, we will find that the (dollar -) valuation of any asset will adhere to the following rule: The value of an (financial) asset is equal to the future cash flows the asset is expected to produce, each of which cash flow is discounted to its present value and then all such present values are aggregated to a single value. This says that in valuing an asset, we must first identify its future cash flows, and then discount each of those cash flows at an appropriate discount rate, and aggregate the figures into a sum, which shall be the asset’ s valuation or price. We will also find that, in a certain sense, the dollar value and the discount rate are interchangeable; in fact, we will note that the discount rate, in a lar ge sense, is the “true” price of the asset. These premises are not universally applicable nor acceptedIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 356 356\\n\\nby all analysts and researchers, but are nonetheless essen- tial to finance.357 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n12.4 Fix ed Income Securities: Bond Components and V aluation F ormula Since the coupon cash flow of a bond constitutes an annu- ity,thecalculat ion of a bond’ sdollar price involves a sim- ple solution: The above formula says that every (annuity) coupon pay- ment plus the one-time face value payment arediscounted and aggregated to present value, which is the bond’ s price. This is based on our “valuation premise.” Here are some important terms to know: Face V alue = Maturity V alue = Par V alue = Principal : These phrases are synonymous and interchangeable. Matu- rity value is the amount of money the investor , or bond- holder /lender , gets back when the bond matures. This represents , in most instances (and herewith) a one-time cash inflow to the investor . Coupon Rate ( C)=Interest Rate (I) : This is the amount of interest that the bond pays. (An exception would be a vari- able rate, but we do not deal with that here.) The dollar amount paid is this rate times the face value. Thus, if theIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 358 358\\n\\nrate is 10% and the Face V alue is $1,000, it will pay $100 per year . If this bond pays semi-annually , the investor will receive two $50 payments peryear, one every six months. This represents an annuity series of cash flows for the life of the bond; this is the bond’ s second set of cash flows. Yield-to-Maturity (YTM) =Market Rate = Discount Rate:This is the market-determined rate at which the bond’ s cash flows – both the Face V alue and the coupon payments – are “priced ,”or discounted , to present value. Do not confuse coupon and market rates; they are separate and mathematically distinct. The market yield will con- stantly change. Coupons are (generally) fixed. We may think of Face V alueand the bond’ sDollar Price in terms of $100s or $1,000s or any multiple thereof. Since the bond’ s price is expressed in terms of 100% of the bond’ s “Par” value, it doesn’ t matter for calculation pur- poses, how many zeros we add on in an illustration or exer- cise. This will be demonstrated immediately below . The bond trader will quote the bond in terms of a percent of par and will then ask the buyer or seller what the “size” of the trade is? In other words ,how much they are dealing with. Of course , in reality ,buying or selling a thousand ,or a million ,dollars ’worth of bonds matters a great deal. An example follows.359 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nCreditors have better memories than debtors. -Benjamin FranklinIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 360\\n\\n12.5 Fix ed Income Securities: Dollar Price and Yield-to-Maturity Fixed Income Securities: Dollar Price and Yield-to-Maturity Calculation Since the coupon ca sh flow is an annuity , a simple valua- tionsolution would utilize the following formula . Take note, that it does not matter how many zeros you use , although, we shall always figure a face value in this text of $1,000 for consistency andconvenience , unless otherwise noted : Example : Coupon .10 (Semi-annual) Term-to-Maturity 5 years Market/Discount Rates (Y-T-M).08, .10, and .12 You’ll need calculators and interest rate tables for this!361 Kenneth S.Bigel 361\\n\\nDiscount Rates Here you shall need to insert the appropriate present value annuity factor (PV AF) for the coupon and the present value factor (PVF) for the Maturity V alue. Do not for get to make the proper adjustments for semi-annual discounting. Dollar V alues Here you shall need to multiply the above factors by the dollar amounts of the coupon/annuity and face value respectively . The “true” price of the bond may , in fact, be considered the YTM. It is conceivable that there exist two bonds with the same maturity (or even issued by the same company) but due to having been issued at dif ferent times, the two bonds carry dif ferent coupons. Thus, the YTM will be the same for each, but the dollar prices will be dif ferent. Therefore, YTM is the true market price, at which bonds’ values are assessed. Question : What would the prices be if the above bond’ s coupon were 0%?Introduction toFinancial Analysis 362\\n\\nAnswer : The PV of just the Face V alue at the appropriate YTM / Discount Rate. Fixed Income Securities: Dollar Price and Yield-to-Maturity (Solution) It is important not only to solve problems, but to interpret them as well. •Note that this illustration has used ordinary annuity factors, rather than only simple present value factors. •The “Quoted Price” is stated as a Percent of363 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nPar. •Premium/(Discount) : ◦You get more (less), you pay more (less)! ◦You get more (less) coupon than the current market yield s, you pay more (less)! It is interesting to note, f or instance, using the discount bond above, thatthe future value of the bond’ sprice equals the future value of its cash flows. 926.41 (1.7908) = $50 (13.181) + 1,000.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 364\\n\\n12.6 Bond Dollar Prices: Discount, P ar, and Premium In the case of investment grade bonds (but not in the case of “junk bonds”) ,corporate issuers usually endeavor to set the coupon so that the initial of fering price for the new bond at the time of issuance is Par (100% of the b ond’s face value) . The coupon and other important terms of the underwriting are written into a legal document called the indentur e. Once the indenture is completed, prospective bonds investors are provided with a “prospectus, ”which lays out the terms of the bond ,thefinancial condition of the com- pany ,and other important facts. Investors have some time until the bond is issued in which to decide whether they wish to purchase the bond or not. In this short time, market yields are subject to fluctuation. As a result, at the ultimate time of issue, the coupon rateand the contemporary mar- ket yield (Y ield-To-Maturity or“YTM” ) will likely have diver ged. Therefore, it is not terribly common to see new bonds being issued at aprice of precisely Par; this of course results in new issue prices being ateither discounts orpremia to Par . There are these two possibilities. Moreover , over the life of the bond, market yields may diver gestillfurther from the coupons. For example, w hen an investor purchases an “old” bond, which may have been issued when market yields – and hence coupons – were lower , it may be looked at as inferior365 Kenneth S.Bigel 365\\n\\nto newer bonds in that its coupon pays less than bonds issued today with the same maturity and credit rating. This iswhy –mathematically –such lower paying bonds trade at a discount to par .You get less (i.e., a lower coupon rate of interest than the current YTM ),so you pay less .Of course, this is also true in reverse. Similarly , for premium bonds, you pay more, because you get more (coupon than the current YTM ). The time value of money discount rate (i.e., YTM) is the great equalizer .You may take two bonds that are similar in all respects except the coupon ;they will trade at the same market yield ,as they should ,by definition ,buttheir dollar prices will dif fer. Therefore, the “true” price of a bond is the YTM! While many people believe that bond prices are stable, any volatility can increase investment risk relative to bond port- folios.

You get more (Coupon than Market Y ield) you pay more!Introduction toFinancial Analysis 366\\n\\n12.7 The T rue Price of a Bond Once again, it may be said thatthe“true price” of a bond is its yield-to-maturity . YTM is the means by which the bond’ s cash flows are discounted or “priced.” Two bonds may have the same credit rating and maturity but may have been issued at dif ferent times and thus will have dif ferent coupon rates, and therefore will be valued at different dollar prices even though, themarket yields today are the same for both . To illustrate this, solve the following problem for two bonds. Y ou will note that the YTM sand TTMs for each of the two bonds in the example are the same, but the coupons differ,causing the dollar prices todiffer. We assume equal creditability for each. YTM = 4% N = 10 P = 2 Cpn. Bond #1 = 4% Cpn. Bond #2 = 0% Solve this without glancing at the solutions.367 Kenneth S.Bigel 367\\n\\nPrice Bond #1 = ($20) (16.3514) + ($1,000) (0.6730) = 100% You should have known that the price would be Par - with- out having to calculate. Price Bond #2 = ($00) (16.3514) + ($1,000) (0.6730) = 67.30% We now also see,that as the coupon rises ,so too does the dollar price.

Return to investors represents cost to the cor- porations that issue the securities; they are the two sides to the same coin. As in the case of “return on investment,” the phrases “return” and “cost of capital” to a corporation are described in percentage terms, i.e., as a rate, and not as a dollar amount. Cost of capital refers to the weighted-aver- age cost of the corporation’ s debt and equity . Both debt and equity provide the corporation with funds with which to acquire assets, so that the corporation may grow . Investors who provide these funds to the corporation expect a return on their investment; this return represents an “economic cost” to the corporation. The money is not free. “Economic Cost” is a financial term, not an account- ing term such as “expense,” and should be understood dif- ferently . •Thecost of debt capital to the corporation is the after –tax cost of interest paid on the debt.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 372 372\\n\\nKey Terms: Cost of Debt Capi- tal Cost of Equity Capital Required Return Risk-free•Thecost of equity capital includes the dividends paid to investors plus their expectation sof capital gains resulting from the growth in earnings. Remember , shareholders may expect to receive divi- dends and to see additions to retained earnings. Should the investors’ expecta- tions, which we may also view as their minimum required return, not be met, they may sell the security . Investors expect that retained earn- ings and other capital sources be productively employed in the growth of the company so that their shares’ value increases – due to increased earnings and growth expectations. Cor- porations therefore must provide the assurance of price appreciation, or shareholders will sell, and/or hire new managers and directors. This prospective price appreciation is also part of the firm’ s capital costs, as viewed from the economist’ s eye. In general, the requir ed return (R) whether for stocks or bonds, con- sists of two parts: one, a return associated with the “risk-free” instrument and the risk-fr ee rate of return (RF); the other , a premium, or extra, return for incremental risk above zero-risk. That is, the required return equals the risk-free373 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nRate of Returnrate of return plus a “market risk premium” (MRP). R = R F+ MRP MRP = R M– RF Here, you will find a graph that depicts these concepts. ◦The phrase “risk premium” (referring to RM– RF) is a bit of a misnomer , as the term “risk” draws your attention toward the horizontal axis rather than the vertical axis where the premium (- return for incremental risk) is observed. ◦The “Market Risk Premium” (MRP) = Market Return (R M) less Risk-free Rate-of-Return (R F). •In the graph above, we have risk (a quantifiable measure) and return, which is measured in per- centage terms. W e also have the overall or aver- age “market risk ” and its corresponding marketIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 374\\n\\nMarket Risk Pre- mium (MRP)return. There is also a theoretical zero-risk investment and its cor- responding risk-free rate of return. Even though the zero- risk investment has no risk (excuse the redundancy), it still provides a positive rate of return. If it provided no return, no one would invest in it. There is no agreement about the real-world proxy for the risk-free instrument; it is usually taken as either the three-month T reasury Bill, or the ten- year T reasury Note. More precisely , the risk-free instru- ment’ s expected and required returns will be the same, and the standard deviation of its return will be zero. Again, the Market Risk Pr emium (MRP) will be the dif ference between the risk-free and market rates of return. In other words, the market return provides a premium or additional return to the investor for taking on a level of risk greater than zero. Any particular invest- ment, or portfolio of investments, may provide more, or less, risk and return than the overall market. In such cases, the investor ’s portfolio may contain a level of risk greater than or less than the market ’s risk level , i.e., to the right or left of the Market Risk on the horizontal axis. Accordingly , the investor may expect to earn more than the market return ,or less. The investor ’s expected return will then be either above o rbelow the Market Return375 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nRational Expecta- tions Portfolio Risk Pre- miumon the vertical axis. Can you draw this? What would be the investor ’sPortfolio Risk Pr emium ? Take note, once again, of the odd use of the term “risk premium” rel- ative to additional return. The more risk one takes on, the proportionally greater should the return be. This is due to the notion of Rational Expectations . One might say that to accept more risk for no added return is irrational, and no one would do that. That is why the slope of the diagonal is positive. The diagonal market line in the diagram reflects this positive risk/reward relationship. The more the risk, the more the (expected) return. •Many researchers will use the 3-month T reasury Bill as the proxy for the theoretical risk-free instrument. This choice has to do with three explanations. ◦First, the United States T reasury is considered the least risky of all debtors (although that may no longer be true). ◦Second, because the 3-month term is so short, market price fluctuation is not at issue; in a very short while, the bills will mature and pay their full, face value.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 376\\n\\n◦Third, Liquidity is also enhanced by the sheer size of the T reasury market itself; size comes with greater trading volume and hence more liquidity . •Not al l agree about the risk- free proxy . Some argue for the use of the 10-Y ear T reasury Note as the real –world equivalent of the risk-free instrument . This is because Equities tend to be longer-term investments and, more importantly , because Credit Spreads (to be discussed in a later chapter) are usually figured in a ten-year timeframe. The sages of Y avne used to say: I am a cr eatur e of G-d and my neighbor is also; my work is in the city and his is in the field; I rise early to work and he rises early to his. As he cannot excel in my work, I cannot excel in his. But you may be tempted to say , ‘I do gr eat things and he small things!’ We have learned that it matters not whether one does much or little, if only he dir ects his heart to heaven.377 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n-Babylonian T almud Tractate Berachoth, 17aIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 378\\n\\n13.3 Inside the Bank er’s Br ain It is important to know both what you are getting into when dealing with a financial adviser andwho may be some of your co-workers if you choose to work on “the street.” What insights do you derive from the table below?1 1.From: Inside the Banker ’s Brain: Mental Models in the Financial Services Industry and Implications for Consumers, Practitioners, and Regulators, by Susan M. Ochs (November 2015). Initiative on Financial Security , The Aspen Institute, W ashington, D.C. ifsinfo@aspeninstitute.or g.379 Kenneth S.Bigel 379\\n\\n13.4 Fix ed Income Risks Risk in theoretical finance is defined mathematically usu- ally as the chance or extent to which the actual return may differ from the required or expected return. “Differ” allows for the actual or “realized” return to be either less or greater than the expected return. From the investor ’s perspective, bond risks may be divided into the following qualitative components: Liquidity Risk – the risk that the security cannot be con- verted to cash at its reasonable intrinsic or “fair market value” due, possibly , to a lack of buyers. Credit- or Default Risk – the possibility that a corporation may, in the worst case, go bankrupt, or , in a lesser case, not honor its interest and other related payments timely and in full. ◦If the firm is in violation of any of the technical terms (“covenants”) of its loan agreement (“indenture”), it may also be considered in “techni- cal-” default even if it is timely in making all its payments. ◦Note that interest must be paid before any dividend payments on preferred and common stocks mayIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 380 380\\n\\nbe made. ◦If a borrowing company defaults on its debt, it may thus become insol- vent which would lead to bank- ruptcy . Inflation Risk – the risk that the return , i.e., theinterest payments, will be eroded over time by inflation, i.e., a reduction in the purchasing power of the interest payments . ◦Note that, in most cases, interest payments are fixed. ◦Many governments sell inflation- linked, or inflation-indexed bonds that have payouts linked to the inflation rate. The United States Treasury sells T reasury Inflation- Protected Securities (TIPS). Inter est Rate (or “Price”) Risk – the negative ef fect on market value s,or price s,due to rising levels ofgeneral interest rates. ◦Interest rates and prices are inversely related. If rates go up, ceteris paribus, bond market prices go down. ◦Think of it this way: If you already own a bond and interest rates, in general, go up since the time of pur- chase, then new bonds will be issued at higher rates than your bond. All else equal, that will make your bond relatively less attractive381 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nand thus its market value will go down. ◦Possibly more than any other risk, this is tied into macroeconomic fac- tors, including Federal Reserve policies. Reinvestment Rate Risk – the risk that cash interest pay- ments received during the life of a bond will be reinvested at less than the rate originally expected, thereby reducing the overall holding period return . ◦When the investor purchases a bond, s/he has some expectation to either spend the money or to rein- vest the interest payments at some anticipated future rate. Should rates go down, the reinvestment rate will be less than expected (or less than it was at the time of purchase) and the investor ’s savings at the bond’ s maturity (i.e., the bond’ s “future value”) will have accumulated to less than that which was originally anticipated. ◦Note that interest rate and reinvest- ment risks are inversely related to (i.e., the opposite of) one another . Country orSover eign Risk – for example, war , changes in administration, etc. ◦When there is war , people ner- vously sell stock, as occurred inIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 382\\n\\nDecember 1990 when the Gulf W ar broke out. When Donald T rump was elected U.S. President in November 2016, the stock market rose sharply . Foreign Curr ency Risk – possible negative ef fect of repa- triation of funds ◦In general, most U .S.companies have substantial assets domiciled or revenues generated overseas. These funds may be repatriated or brought home at an unfavorable exchange rate. Thus, even American compa- nies bear some foreign currency risks even though their stocks are dollar denominated. Notes: •“Nominal” rates (or prices) are not adjusted (lower) for inflation. •“Real” means “corrected” for inflation, i.e., adjusted. The real rate will be lower than the nominal rate, given some inflation. •The following phrases all usually mean percent:383 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nreturn, rate, yield, mar gin, bracket.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 384\\n\\n13.5 Interest Rate and Rein vestment Rate Risks An additional, clarifying word about interest rate and rein- vestment rate risks is warranted at this time. If in general, interest rates go up, market prices for existing, “older” bonds will go down – and vice versa. General inter- est rates and bond prices are inversely related. In an envi- ronment where market rates have gone up, bond investors holding “old” bonds will receive less interest income than if they had purchased “new” bonds that were issued more recently – at higher (coupon) rates. This will cause market values for existing bonds to go down; they are simply worth less competitively . Rising rates are “bad” news for (existing) bondholders in terms of interest rate risk. However , bondholders will be able to reinvest their interest proceeds at higher rates than before if rates rise. Investors receive regular , periodic interest payments over the life of the bond, which upon receipt, is assumed to be reinvested into other alternatives that pay higher rates than before. Thus, rising rates are “good” news for bondholders – in terms of reinvestment risk. In short, interest rate and reinvestment risks are inversely related to one another . The table below summarizes the relationships vis á vis the bond investor .385 Kenneth S.Bigel 385\\n\\nIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 386\\n\\n13.6 Credit Ratings Corporations are rated by credit-rating agencies that assess a corporation’ s ability to service its debt (i.e., to pay inter- est and principal in full and on time) and, thus, to avoid a default and to ultimately keep bankruptcy at bay . This is a risk, which may also be referred to as “default risk.” We have already examined three solvency ratios which attempt to provide some insight into this risk. Clearly , there are many more tools and considerations that enter into the process of credit analysis and rating. Companies must pay for this service, but not all do so, as some bond issues are too small to justify the expense, while others may be sold directly to institutional investors and thus do not require a rating. Today , there are two major rating agencies: Standard & Poor ’s (S&P) and Moody’ s.Fitch is still a third agency , but it does not enjoy the market presence of the others. In addition, there are numerous nationally recognized statisti- cal rating or ganizations or “NRSRO’ s” that perform similar functions (see: https://www .sec.gov/ocr/ocr -current- nrsros.html ). The agencies rate bonds on the scale illus- trated below . As you will note, there are some dif ferences in the rating scales, and, although not visible in the ratings themselves, the manners in which the agencies conduct their respective analyses and what they consider important also dif fer from one agency to the other . As a result, the agencies may not rate the same bond issuer the same.387 Kenneth S.Bigel 387\\n\\nWithin each rating category , the agencies may append addi- tional notation, such as “A-” in the case of S&P . This pro- vides some further refinement to the ratings. Note: The “S&P 500” is a stock index and does not apply to bonds. Ratings will clearly af fect the bond’ s yield – in inverse relation to the rating, with lower ratings generally bringing higher yields. That is to say thatthe lower the cr edit rating, the higher the default risk. A gr eater default risk means a lower dollar price, which, in turn means a higher yield. The better the bond’ s initial rating, the lower the bond’ s coupon rate of interest, and, of course, the lower the issuer ’s cost of debt capital; this is alsoIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 388\\n\\ntrue for the bond’ s subsequent secondary market yield, (a.k.a. yield-to-maturity; YTM). Do not con- fuse coupon and market yields; they are separate. The coupon determines how much the interest bond pays, whereas the YTM is the ever -changing market discount rate which is used to price the bond. The rating agencies do not collude or necessarily agree with one another; in some cases, the agen- cies may rate the same company somewhat dif fer- ently . Interestingly , the bond market itself seems to understand what the true yield for a bond should be; indeed, yields often adjust long before a rating change (i.e., either an upgrade or a downgrade) announcement. Further , a bond’ s rating is not nec- essarily “correct.” In the case of municipal bonds, the agencies con- duct similar analyses and provide similar ratings. The interpretation of municipal ratings, however , is somewhat dif ferent in practice, with municipal bonds less likely to default than their ratings might imply . In some instances, municipal bonds may be insured by private insurance companies, in most of which cases the bonds will therefore bear a “AAA” rating regardless of its intrinsic creditabil- ity. Most insurers are considered to be in the best financial health. United States T reasury and Agency bonds are highly rated but are no longer perceived as being completely risk free. In 201 1, Standard & Poor ’s389 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nKey Terms Covenants Indenturelowered its rating for T reasury Securities from AAA to AA+. The agency felt that the congres- sional deadlock in arriving at a budget agreement warranted the downgrade. Since then, the agency has not upgraded the rating back to AAA. The other rating agencies have kept the T reasury’ s rat- ing at AAA. “Agencies” are considered slightly lower in quality than “Treasuries” and will therefore trade at very slightly higher yields. The markets “know” how to price their securities based on YTM and its associated default risk. While the rating agencies do not provide the details of the manner in which they conduct their ratings, it is accepted that their formulae consist of a combination of the exami- nation of the issuer ’s financial health (based on its financial statements), its economic environment, and an examination of the bond’ s covenants. Covenants are agreed-upon terms to which the issuer assures it will adhere; in a way it is a restriction imposed by the lender in order to secure or strengthen his position. For instance, the issuer may assure the investors that its financial ratios will remain within certain parame- ters, or that it will not issue any further debt, which shall be senior to the issue at hand. In general, such negative covenants will also prohibit the firm from paying too much in dividends, selling or pledging assets to other lenders, maintaining collateral in good condition, or adding on more debt. T imely interestIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 390\\n\\nIn Default Technical Defaultand principal payments wo uld certainly be included in this category .These assurances are spelled out in the bond indentur e, a legal document in which all the terms of the bond issue are spelled out, including the bond’ s maturity and coupon interest rate. Although a bond issuer , or borrower , may pay its bond interest in full and on time, which is to say it is not indefault ,any violation of any of the bond indenture’ s covenants may be interpreted as a techni- cal default and result in a downgrading of the bond’ s credit rating. The bond covenants are aimed at providing investors with reasonable assurances of the issuer ’s fealty to its obligations under the bond, but not so much as to disenable it from running its business ef fectively . Failure to abide by the covenants is, thus, a negative circumstance . The restrictiveness of the bond’ s covenants will vary . Secured, or asset-backed ,securities will have less restric- tive covenants than unsecured issues. Furthermore, lower rated, non-investment grade, bonds are likely to be more restrictive and more complex, and hence will require a more careful reading prior to purchase and investment. Evaluation of these risk iersecurities’ covenants is rela- tively more important than in the case of investment grade bonds. Moody’ s places some emphasis inthe determination of its ratings for high-yield bonds on the issue’ s covenants. High yield bonds tend to attract more sophisticated investors who are capable of studying the technical terms of the covenants; moreover , many such issues are placed privately among institutional investors.391 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nLienInvestment grade bonds will typically contain three standard covenants. First, there may be a covenant regarding “ liens, ” which assure the investor that no other party may obtain a “senior” (prior) claim to the asset (or collateral) subsequent to the bond’ s issuance. Under the law, alienis a claim by a person upon another person’ s property for purposes of securing pay- ment of a debt or the fulfillment ofan obligation. If there is aprior lien on a property , no other person can subse- quently make a claim on the same property . By manner of another example, when you buy a house, your attorney will conduct a “lien search,” to be sure that no one else owns the house except the seller with whom you are dealing. Next, a covenant will protect against any reduction in seniority of the bond in case of a mer ger of the issuer with another corporation. This covenant will ensure that the bond is paid of f first in any case. Finally , another covenant may address the sale of an under- lying asset – in the case of a secured bond. Obviously , should an asset underlying a collateralized bond be sold, the bond’ s financial status will change markedly . Such assets ought not to be sold unless the bond is also redeemed. There is no doubt that credit ratings are critical to pricing primary and secondary market issues. Ratings influence both the coupon rates of interest in the primary market, and market yields, or yields-to-maturity in the secondary mar- kets.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 392\\n\\nKey Terms: Yield Curve Yield-to- Maturity Term-to- Maturity 13.7 The Yield Curv e TheYield Curve depicts the relationship between Yield-to-Maturity (YTM) and Term (or Time)- to-Maturity (TTM) for a given class of bond, such as T reasury Notes and Bonds, Municipal Bonds, or Corporate Bonds .When one speaks of the Yield Curve without specifying the instrument, it is assumed to refer to the market for T reasury securities. The yield usually is stated in nominal terms, i.e., not in real terms, which would adjust for inflation. The horizontal axis is the term, orTime-to-M aturity (TTM), and the vertical is Yield-to-M aturity (YTM) or market yield . The slope of the yield curve can be flat, positive (upward sloping) or negative. It may , at times, be kinked. As will be shown later, YTM will determine the dollar -price for a given bond. Under “normal” circumstances, the yield curve will reflect an upward, but not nec- essarily linear , slope; that is, as maturities get longer , yields will also rise. The the- ory of Liquidity Pr eference attempts to explain this. Investors prefer being liquid rather than illiquid. When liquid, investors have the entire range of options available to them; they may either spend393 Kenneth S.Bigel 393\\n\\nLiquidity Preference Inverted Yield Curveor invest their money .When illiquid, choices and alternatives are reduced or eliminated. The longer one ties up his money , the greater his illiquidity . As one ’s illiquidity increases ,s/he will accordingly demand more and more return as com- pensation for the illiquidity , hence a posi- tively sloped yield curve. The Y ield C urve need not always be pos- itively sloped ,however . For instance, i n times of tight Federal Reserve monetary activities, short-term rates will be driven up. As markets have learned to interpret tight money policy as ef fective inflation- reducing medicine, which takes ef fect over future periods, the longer end of the yield curve tends to decline, leading to a negatively sloped, or “inverted,” yield curve . As Fed tightening usually does not last long (the 2004-2007 period being an obvious exception to this), inversions are similarly short-lived. The Y ield Curve normally is positively sloped due to Liq- uidity Pr eference –although it do es not have to be a straight line. Below , we observe average yields for three-month to ten-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 394\\n\\nyear government (T reasury) bonds for the decades noted. Yields are first stated in nominal (unadjusted) terms, fol- lowed by real (adjusted for inflation) terms. In general, the yield curve is s tated in nominal terms, because that i show bond yields are quoted in the market. Note:395 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nThe yield curve, typically , is presented in nominal terms. The following link provides some insight into the “histor- ical yield curve,” which is to say , how the yield curve has changed over the last few decades. http://fixedincome.fidelity .com/fi/FIHistoricalY ieldIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 396\\n\\n13.8 The T erm Structure of Interest Rates: F our Yield Curv e Theories Here we shall present four theories that attempt to explain why the Y ield Curve may take on one or another slope – upward (positive), flat, or downward (negative). W e can- not say that any one theory is more correct than the other , nor can we necessarily reconcile one theory in terms of another . Still, the following theories are eminently infor- mative. 1. Pur e Expectations – The Market Y ield reflects the aver- age of future short-term rates. First, we assume that investors think about the future and, specifically about the future direction of short-term interest rates. In this notion, we say that the observed Y ield Curve is, in a sense, secondary to what market players believe – in their minds – future short-term yields will be. If, as in the mathematical example below , market participants believe that future short-term yields will go higher and higher , then the observed yield curve will reflect this collective belief and be positive in slope – and vice versa. In other words, the Y ield Curve reflects market participants’ apri- oribeliefs. What makes this interesting is that while we can directly observe the Y ield Curve – after all, it is quoted in the media, and by traders and brokers – it is first the unex- pressed thoughts and beliefs about the direction of future short-term rates that determine the Y ield Curve’ s openly397 Kenneth S.Bigel 397\\n\\nexpressed slope. W e know what is in the public’ s minds regarding the future by observing the ef fect of their collec- tive thought on the slope and shape of the “Y ield Curve.” The Y ield Curve expresses what people think about the future! Similarly , the observed Y ield Curve – mathematically – will express the average of market participants’ expecta- tions about the course of future short-term rates. For exam- ple, standing here today , in the here and now , and assuming first that the investor ’s horizon is two years, the investor is faced with two choices: (1) Buy a two-year bond, or (2) Buy a one-year bond and “roll it over” for another year when it comes due at the end of the first year . Given this line of thinking, if his horizon is three years, an investor can buy a three-year bond, or choose to consecu- tively roll it over twice. If we assume initially that the two choices in each case should be and are equivalent, we can extrapolate the investor ’s beliefs about the “Spot Curve,” i.e., the market’ s collective belief about future short-term rates, from the Y ield Curve, working backwards. Let’ s clar- ify by mathematical illustration. Here is an example of how we may calculate “Spot Rates,” or the “Spot Curve” given the Y ield Curve (“Market Y -T- M”). Introduction toFinancial Analysis 398\\n\\nQuestion: “x” and “y” represent the future short-term rates that market play- ers anticipate. Specifically , “x” represents the rate for the second period. Likewise, “y” represents the rate for the third period. Working backwards from the observed Y ield Curve, what are the values for the two unknowns? Again, we must assume that the two alternatives are equivalent. This mathematical process, by the way , is referred to as “Boot Strapping.” Solution: (1.08)2= (1 + .07) (1 + x) x= .09009 where, x = 2r1 (i.e., the one-year rate in the second year) The two alternatives – that of buying (or lending) a two- year instrument or buying (or lending) a one-year instru- ment and rolling it over at the end of the first year – must be viewed as equivalent alternatives if this idea were to work. And it does because should one alternative be superior , rational, smart market players would go for that399 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\none, and the market’ s efficient self-correcting mechanism would drive the alternatives together . This is known as the Law of One Price . This “law” says that if two equal alternatives are present, they must offer the same price or , in this case, yield. If one of the choices were more attractive, investors would choose that one, dri- ving up the price and lowering the yield. They would sell the other , which would have, in the end, an equal and oppo- site ef fect. While we have used here the term “investors,” this ar gument refers to the activities of both borrowers and lenders, in fact. You should be able to draw these two curves (i.e., both the YTM Y ield Curve and Spot Curve, given the calculated values of “x” and “y”) on a chart, with the yield on the vertical and the years-to-maturity on the horizontal. Note that after the first year , the two curves diver ge, with the Spot Curve, in this example, rising above the Y ield Curve, pulling it upward. Investors expect future, short-term rates to increase! Of course, if the Y ield Curve is inverted (neg- atively sloped), the spot curve would be lower that it and we would conclude that future, short-term rate expectations are decreasing. As for the nomenclature noted above, and more formally speaking, “ 2r1” means the “spot rate” starting at the begin- ning of the second period for the length of one period, while “ 3r1“starts at the beginning of the third period for one period’ s length. Again, and in summary , why does this math work? This is based on two notions: first, that market players are “ratio- nal,” and make optimal decisions that maximize their wealth; second, that markets react “ef ficiently” to a per-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 400\\n\\nceived mispricing should the two opportunities not be equivalent. T ogether , these two concepts (i.e., Rational Expectations and Ef ficient Markets) act in unison and cause the alternatives to be equivalent at present. What will actually happen tomorrow is another story . Under this Pure Expectations Theory , we say that the Y ield Curve has no apriori upward (positive) or downward (neg- ative; inverted) bias. The slope of the Y ield Curve simply reflects whether people think rates will be going up or down and will acquire its slope accordingly . The observed Yield Curve’ s slope thus is a consequence of Pure Expec- tations. 2. Liquidity Pr eference – Investors prefer Liquidity to illiquidity . Investors prefer to be liquid at all times in order to have the freedom to choose whether to spend or invest their funds. Don’ t we all want to be free? Should investors choose to tie up their money in an investment, they would demand to be compensated for the illiquidity that comes with investment. Should they tie up their money longer and longer , they would demand that they be increasingly compensated, in terms of higher yield, for their increasing illiquidity . Under this theory , therefore, we conclude that the Y ield Curve would have a notable upward bias. The theories of Pure Expectations and Liquidity Preference are said to work hand-in-hand. When we get both theories working in the same direction, that is, when the Spot Curve is positive, we get a positively sloped Y ield Curve. How- ever, if Pure Expectations are such that market participants believe that future short-term rates will decline, the slope will be determined by which force is greater than the other401 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n– whether Pure Expectation outweighs Liquidity Prefer- ence or not. The following formula expresses this theoreti- cal notion: (1.07) (1 + x + L) = (1.08)2 While we can measure “x,” i.e., the spot rates, and have just done so, the Liquidity Preferences (L) of the market are not measurable. There are two more theories to go. 3. Market Segmentation – different segments of the yield curve attract dif ferent issuers and investors and are thus subject to varying supply/demand conditions respectively . These conditions will determine the independent slopes of each segment. In Market Segmentation Theory , we say that participants generally invest or borrow in limited portions or “seg- ments” of the market. Commercial Banks invest very little in the long-term whereas Pension Funds are heavily invested there. Dif ferent players tend to “reside” in dif fer- ent “segments.” Given this segmentation, rates within it would be a func- tion of the supply and demand characteristics of each indi- vidual segment, separately and alone. Any changes in a particular maturity’ s yield would not af fect any other seg- ment, or rate, for any other maturity . There would, thus, be no ex-ante bias whatsoever for the slope of the Y ield Curve. In fact, the Y ield Curve could conceivably have multiple kinks. 4. Pr eferr ed Habitats – Market Segmentation may beIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 402\\n\\naltered by yield incentives whereby investors and borrow- ers may be lured away from their Preferred Habitats. Preferred Habitats Theory comes to the rescue! Maybe. This theory says that yes, players indeed have their pre- ferred segments, or habitats, but they (i.e., both lenders and borrowers) can be lured away from their preferred habitats if interest rates are attractive enough – low enough for bor- rowers and high enough for investors. YOU decide!403 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n13.9 Credit Spreads Credit Spreads represent the incremental yield provided to compensate for additional default risk above a no-risk alternative (Treasury Notes), and for a given maturity – usually 10-years. We have drawn in the yield curves for Treasuries and “B”-rated Corporates. The Credit Spread below is represented by the dif ference in yields between points “B” and “T .” Remember that the lower the cr edit rating, the higher the default risk. A gr eater default risk means a lower dollar price, which, in turn, means a higher yield. Remember that that the lower the cr edit rating, the higher the default risk. A gr eater default risk means a lower dollar price, which, in turn means a higher yield. Questions : Which companies issue credit ratings? What are the important credit ratings?Introduction toFinancial Analysis 404 404\\n\\nWhat do “Investment Grade” and “Junk” or “High-Y ield” Bonds mean? Reality Check : Credit spreads are not constant. During weak economic periods, credit spreads widen, in response to fear – but not necessarily the reality – of the perceived risks associated with lower -rated bonds. In fact, default rates themselves may not worsen, but still, people get ner- vous. In such times, people demand more premium return versus T reasuries than before. How exactly does this happen? Many will sell their lower - rated bonds and buy safer T reasuries with the sale pro- ceeds. Lower -rated bonds’ prices therefore fall and their yields rise; T reasury prices will thus rise, and yields will go down. Credit spreads widen. Remember that price and yield (i.e., discount rates) are inversely related. This does not say that actual credits, i.e., default risks, have wors- ened; that may or may not eventually happen. A bond may be considered a “credit.” This phenomenon – whereby credit spreads widen – is referred to as a flight to quality . Below we illustrate the flight to quality . The Flight to Quality Yields405 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nAbove, in anticipation of weak times ahead, Credit Spreads widen from B 0less T 0to B1less T 1. That does not imply that default rates have worsened in reality , although, in time, as conditions worsen, that could happen as well. When rates increased between 1978 and 1982, the spread between (T en-Y ear) T reasuries and Baa Corporate Bonds widened. Baa and BBB bond- holders lost money in part due to increased rates and, in addition, due to a widening of the spread (such bondholders would have lost less in T rea- suries). Credit spreads were wide when the technology “bubble” burst in 2000-2001. Greater credit spreads reduce corporations’ ability to borrow and thus serve to dampen economic growth. Just prior to the Banking Crisis of 2007-2008, Credit Spreads were very narrow by historical standards. T o some prognosticators, the optimism implicit in such narrowIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 406\\n\\nspreads boded ill for near -term economic conditions. They were right. Many things can happen that may interact with credit spreads, including moves up or down in the entire yield curve. What is important to recognize, at the base level, is that lower grade bonds – and their yields – are (usually) priced relative to T reasuries, i.e., at some premium to T rea- sury yields. The lower the credit rating, the greater the impact of “nervousness” on yield.

High yield securities merely have lower credit ratings and therefore higher yields. In 1978, there was less than $10 billion worth of junk bonds outstanding – in terms of aggregate face value. In 2006, this figure exceeded $1 trillion! Whereas in the past, most issues consisted of “fallen angels,” or securities issued by corporations that once enjoyed investment grade credit ratings, but fell on hard times, today most junk bonds are originally issued as high yield securities. Further , emer ging markets the world over add to new issuance; the prospective high returns attract many investors. This low-grade security growth has precipitated two other interesting phenomena: the markets for “syndicated loans” and “leveraged loans.” Syndicated loans are package deals provided often by investment banks rather than commer- cial banks, which traditionally have made such lar ge loans. These loans are aggregated and packaged, and then “secu- ritized,” that is, sold as securities. Many of these bonds went bad in the 2007-2008 Banking Crisis. A leveraged loan is one which is made to companies that already mayIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 408 408\\n\\nKey Terms: Distressed Debt Vulture Fundshave low-grade bonds outstanding; such loans are then often syndicated. Distr essed debt consists of junk bonds whose companies are in such dire straits that their yields are substantially higher than the risk-free rate. “Defaulted debt” represents corporations who have defaulted on their bond issues. A “default” may consist merely of the violation of its bank lending agreement or its bond’ sindentur e, i.e., the legal document, which sets forth all the terms of the loan, and which may require that the issuer maintain its financial ratios within certain parameters. It may also result, more seriously , from a late or missed interest payment. Vultur e funds are often operated by hedge funds and attempt to profit of f the remains of bankrupt corporations by pur- chasing the defaulted bonds and repos- sessing the company’ s assets. The vultures then sell of fthe assets at a profit. Typically , default rates increase as the economy enters a recession. Default rates are sometimes defined as the dollar amount of defaults relative to the aggre- gate amounts outstanding. The credit rat- ing agencies define default rates in connection with the number of high-yield issuers who default.409 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n13.11 Summary: Interest Rates, the Corpor ation, and Financial Mark ets Corporations are intimately connected with the financial markets because the value of the corporation depends on ever-changing prices reflected in the markets, and because corporations periodically require access to the financial markets in order to acquire capital for growth. In this chap- ter, we outlined four financial markets: money , capital, derivatives, and foreign exchange markets. The focus was, of course, on securities markets, that is, the markets for stocks and bonds. Securities markets, in turn, are connected to the macroeconomic world, and monetary and fiscal poli- cies are a key component of security markets analysis. The means by which corporations gain access to the finan- cial markets and its capital raising function is the subject of investment banking. In particular , we are interested in new securities’ issuance, or initial public of ferings (IPOs), but I-banking serves various other essential roles in our finan- cial sector . Interest rates af fect securities’ valuations, most visibly affecting bonds’ prices, but the impact on equities is notable also. This is but one example of the connections between macroeconomics and securities markets. In this section, we also glanced at the interconnections between interest rates of various sorts. There is much to know .Introduction toFinancial Analysis 410 410\\n\\nNote: Review questions for Chapters T welve through Fourteen will appear at the end of Chapter Fourteen.411 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nChapter 14: Equity V aluation and Return MeasurementIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 412 412\\n\\n14.1 Chapter F ourteen: L earning Outcomes Learning Objectives In this chapter , you will: •Calculate the prices of both Preferred and Common Stocks, and Capital Gains using the Dividend Discount Models. •Explor ethe various approaches to stock valua- tion. •Uncover the various sub-elements within the Dividend Discount Model. •Provide both Annual Portfolio Returns and Multi-year Geometric Returns.413 Kenneth S.Bigel 413\\n\\n14.2 The Philosoph y of Equity Valuation Earlier , we read that “the value of an asset is equal to the future cash flows the asset is expected to produce, dis- counted and aggregated to its present value.” W e refer to this value or price as “intrinsic value.” This Valuation Premise shall serve as the starting point for the valuation (i.e., pricing) of equity . In this section, we will commence with a simple example of stock valuation, one which perfectly corresponds with this statement. W e shall then observe that the formulation does not conform to, or is not applicable to, many , or most, equity situations. For example, our starting point will be the application of this TVM premise to Preferred Stocks that have fixed dividends. However , what about other stocks, whose dividends are not constant? For this there will be another model, a variation on the original model. What about investors who buy stocks for capital growth rather than income? In other words, what about investors who do not care about dividends, but instead purchase stocks for profit? Most American stocks pay no dividends at all! What are such stocks worth? For that too, we shall offer a further refinement of the original model.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 414 414\\n\\nTo summarize, we shall systematically address shortcom- ings in the initial model and progressively build more com- prehensive and complex models, which encompass all, or many “complaints” about the simplicity of the earlier mod- els. Keep this in mind as we proceed down the equity valu- ation path. For most things ar e differ ently valued by those who have them and by those who wish to get them: what belongs to us, and what we give away , seems very pr ecious to us. – Aristotle Nicomachean Ethics, Book IX (F. H. Peters translation)415 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n14.3 Equity V aluation We look at Equity V aluation from dif ferent perspectives. •Going-Concern value sees the firm from a per- petual operating perspective. It is an ongoing concern that will produce EBIT (or EBITDA) forever . •Liquidation V alue is diametrically opposed to the going concern value. Here we imagine what the firm’ s assets would fetch were the firm to go out of business and its assets liquidated, i.e., sold of f to the highest bidders or available buy- ers. •Book V alue (BV) represents the accountant’ s stated net (common) equity divided by the num- ber of shares outstanding (NOSO). •Relative V alue compares a security to another based on some shared or relative metric, such as default risk.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 416 416\\n\\n•Market V alue (P for Price per Share) is defined as the market value of the firm’ s equity . Markets can misprice assets on occasion. •Intrinsic V alue (V) represents the “intrinsic” or “internal” worth of the company based on finan- cial analytic formulae and models. Y ou may think of this as what the shares are “really” worth. Such formulae often rely on a discounted cash flow paradigm, e.g., the DDM. The intrin- sic value may dif fer from the market price, thereby of fering investors the opportunity to purchase shares cheaply or sell the shares short, if over -valued. Does V = P? If not, what advan- tage does the investor have? All the foregoing valuations may dif fer from one another . In a perfectly ef ficient market, observed market prices should equal intrinsic values. Equity V aluation and the Macroeconom y How we value the stock market now and in the417 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nfutur e influences major economic and social policy decisions that affect not only investors, but society at lar ge, even the world. If we exaggerate the pr e- sent and futur e value of the stock market, then as a society we may invest too much in business start-ups and expansions, and too little in infrastructur e, edu- cation, and other forms of human capital. If we think the market is worth mor e than it r eally is, we may become complacent in funding our pension plans, in maintaining our savings rate, in legislating an impr oved Social Security system, and in pr ovid- ing other forms of social insurance. W e might also lose the opportunity to use our expanding financial technology to devise new solutions to the genuine risks – to our homes, cities, and livelihoods – that we face . -Irrational Exuberance by Robert J. Shiller Preface, p. xii (Princeton University Press, 2000)Introduction toFinancial Analysis 418\\n\\n14.4 The Dividend Discount Model (DDM): Fix ed Dividend or No- Growth Version We shall assume that the security’ sIntrinsic V alue (V) will be equal to the market price (P), i.e., that P = V . Intrin- sic value refers to what the security is “truly ”worth. T o the extent that P ≠ V , one would be presented with the opportunity to earn an extraordinary profit (by either buy- ing cheaply or selling “richly”) .Hereforward , we shall use P rather than V , although y ou may see V used elsewhere. A stock is a kind of perpetuity ; the corporation, as a going concern, is eternal. Dividends will be paid in perpetuity . Unlike bonds, there is no face value to be paid at a spec- ified time in the future. The only cash flows are the divi- dends. This formula says that the price of a stock is equal to its aggregated discounted future cash flows, i.e., the dividends discounted to present value. Since, for the moment we assume that dividends are fixed (as in a preferr edstock), the foregoing, never -ending equation may be simplified algebraically to the following (as was demonstrated for a perpetuity , only the terms have been modified to accommo- date stock):419 Kenneth S.Bigel 419\\n\\nThis simplification works because of the “Law of Limits,” discussed earlier in our TVM section. Interestingly , by transposing, the above formula may be re-formulated as: Note : D ÷P is the Dividend Y ield! While corporations pay dividends quarterly , the formula looks at annual dividends. Recall that, in the case of a perpetuity , discounting frequency has no ef fect on Present Value.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 420\\n\\n14.5 The Dividend Discount Model (DDM): Constant Growth V ersion a.k.a. “The Gordon Model” Of course ,not all stocks pay fixed dividends. Let us take a small step forward and assume that the dividend grows – at aconstant rate of growth. In this version of the Dividend Discount Model (DDM), the constant dividend growth rate is designated as “G”: This formula is identical to a constant growth perpetuity . The nomenclature was altered here in order to suit common stocks. W ith some simple algebraic transposition, we can re-formulate the DDM so as to isolate the discount rate to one side:421 Kenneth S.Bigel 421\\n\\nCode :D0= the last reported Annual Dividend ( i.e., the sum of the last four , quarter lydividends) D1= D0(1 + G) G = the imputed growth rate for dividends. Note, interestingly , that this means that the discount rate is equal to the sum of the dividend yield plus the growth rate in dividends. This formulation presents a percentages view on the model; all terms are percentages. Note also that when G = 0, we have the “no-growth” ver- sion of the DDM. If G > 0, we have the “Constant-Growth” DDM. As discussed in the TVM section, R must exceed G for both practical / financial and mathematical reasons. Remember that when we speak of “growth,” we refer to growth in dividends, which, in turn, comes from growth in sales and profits. Questions:Introduction toFinancial Analysis 422\\n\\nGiven: R = .15 D = $1.50 G = 0 1.What is the price? 2.What happens to P if R goes down? 3.What happens to P if G goes down? Solutions: 1.P = ($1.50) / .15 = $10 2.Just as in the TVM, as the discount rate decreases, present values (P) increase. So too here! 3.“R – G” increases, and D1 decreases, both of which result in, or cause, a lower price Note: This version of the DDM is a.k.a. “The Gordon Model, ” named after Myron Gordon. This idea is not without its423 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\ncontroversy or weaknesses, the discussion of which is beyond our current scope.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 424\\n\\n14.6 Dividend Discount Model (DDM) (Problems) Let us now apply all that we learned regarding calculating Price using the DDM. Solve the following problems .In the course of doing so, explain why Price and Return (at bottom) change from solution to solution. 425 Kenneth S.Bigel 425\\n\\nBuy when ther e’s blood in the str eets. – Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777-1836)Introduction toFinancial Analysis 426\\n\\n14.7 Dividend Discount Model (Solutions) The following table presents the solutions to the problems on the prior page. •As G increases, R – G decreases, and P increases. G, as the growth rate in dividend, also affects D 1(because D 1= D0[1 + G]). As G increases, so too does D 1.427 Kenneth S.Bigel 427\\n\\n•So far , we have assumed that P = V , i.e., Market Price = Intrinsic V alue. If however , V > P , we then have an unusual opportunity to achieve an excess (“unearned”) return; if the opposite per- tains, we should sell the stock – if we already own it, or sell it short – if we are aggressive Stock prices climb a wall of worry . -AnonymousIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 428\\n\\n14.8 What About Quarterly Dividends? No doubt you have noticed that the Dividend Discount Model, as so far presented, assumed that dividends are paid annually . We all know that companies pay dividends in quarterly payments. Does this dif ference in payment frequency matter? Should we not employ the DDM using quarterly payments? If dividends are paid quarterly , most of the funds will arrive sooner . Is it not a basic principle of the T ime V alue of Money that if the funds come in sooner the present value is greater , and isn’ t a stock’ s price pre- sent value? Ought that not af fect the way we write the formula? To adjust for this, we modify the formula and arrive at the following, using the simpler no-growth version: Price = (D / 4) ÷ [(1 + R)1/4– 1] To illustrate this, we shall assume that: D = $1 R = 0.10 When we calculate based on annual dividends, we get: P + D / R P = 1 ÷ 0.10 = $10429 Kenneth S.Bigel 429\\n\\nWhen we calculate based on quarterly dividends, we get: P = (D / 4) ÷ [(1 + R)1/4–1] P = (1 / 4) ÷ [(1.10)1/4–1] = $10.37 This value is substantially higher!

P = [D 0(1 + G)] ÷ (R – G) = D1÷ (R – G) The variables are: Price = Intrinsic V alue We must solve for “P .” The market price (P) will equal the security’ s intrinsic value (V) if the security is ef ficiently – or correctly – priced in the market. That is what we are try- ing to uncover with the formula. W e will assume here that P = V . The Last Annual Dividend433 Kenneth S.Bigel 433\\n\\nD0is the prior year ’s dividend, and is thus a known, histor- ical fact. D1 is the next dividend. Next Y ear’s Dividend Next year ’s dividend depends on our expected dividend growth rate, “G.” D1= D0×(1 + G) Growth Rate in the Dividend The dividend’ s growth rate is defined as: G = (D 1÷D0)–1 However , we do not know D 1,thenext year’s dividend. Therefore, we need a formula for “G.” Here, is the non- intuitive formula for G. G= ROE × RR ROE = Return-on-Equity = (NI ÷ Eq.) RR = Retention Rate = (NI – D ÷ NI) = (A.R.E. ÷ NI) A.R.E. = Addition to Retained Earnings = NI – D Therefore: G = (NI ÷ Eq.) (A.R.E. ÷ NI) G = (A.R.E.) ÷ Eq.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 434\\n\\nThe “G,” which we formulated above represents the growth rate of the firm’ s Equity and not of the Dividend! We must demonstrate that the two growth rates are the same. W e will examine “G” more closely below and intro- duce “R.”435 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\n14.10 A Closer L ook at Dividend Growth In order to fully understand the “g” term in the dividend discount model, a term which is not intuitive, let us have a closer look. (As you go through this example, keep in mind that, as the company retains earnings the balance sheet gets “bigger .”)We are given the following information about a company: If: Then: Given this information, G = (ROE) × (RR) = (.10) × (.90) = .09.By definition, G, the growth rate in the dividend, must alsobe defined, far more simply , as: G = [(D 1) ÷ (D 0)] – 1. This simple formula is readily understood. Remember that G = ARE / NI,Introduction toFinancial Analysis 436 436\\n\\nor the rate at which the Equity grows. T ake note that, here, we have assumed that G, ROE, and RR are constants. Let’s see if the two formulae work out to be the same; if so, we will therefore also know that the “G = (ROE) (RR)” formula makes sense, given the same data. Let’ s see first how the simple formula, G = [(D 1) ÷ (D 0)] – 1, works out using an account- ing–type (i.e., chronological) approach. This gets us the same result – as it should! (In fact, we could not have known the value of D 1had we not had the first formulation!) This notion assumes that the retention rate (and payout ratio), dividend growth rate, and ROE are constants. Y ou’ll note that the equity is growing at the same rate of 9%. This latter table says that if we earn and retain earnings, we will be able to pay out more money in dollars as dividends later .

R =f(general levels of interest rates, default risk, credit spreads) General levels of interest rates : All interest rates are inter- related. In general, if rates go up for a base rate, such as Treasuries, other rates will follow . Default risk : If a company’ s bond default risk increases, the dividend on preferred stock will also be less secure. Dis- count rates on “Preferreds” will go up and prices will go down. So too will the discount rate and price of common equity follow . The company’ s ability to pay common stock dividends and to retain additional earnings will be reduced. Remember: Default risk, essentially , has to do with the chance that a corporate borrower , or issuer of bonds, will not pay the interest on its borrowings in full and on time. Credit Spreads : We know that credit spreads reflect rate differentials between, typically , 10-year T reasury NotesIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 442 442\\n\\nand 10-Y ear B-rated Corporates. However , we can create spreads between Notes and anything, such as discount rates on “Preferreds.” Thus, spreads may be observed between T-Notes, Preferred-, and Common-Stock Returns. And we already know that spreads narrow or widen according to economic circumstances and outlooks. If spreads widen, required stock returns will go up and prices will go down. These three variables, when aggregated, will constitute the stock’ s risk (β). “R” can be stated (again) formulaically: RM= RF+ MRP MRP = Market Risk Pr emium = R M– RF RM= RF+ (RM– RF) βM The Market Return (R M) equals the Risk-free Rate (R F) plus a Market Risk Premium. 443 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nA specific portfolio ’sor security’ sreturn (RPor R S) will equal the Risk-free Rate (R F)plusa Market Risk Premium (RM– RF), adjusted for the relative risk (β S) of the portfo- lio.βP(portfolio risk) orβS(individual security risk) can be equal to, greater than, or less than the Market’ s Risk level (βM).Thus, we can also speak of a “Portfolio Risk Pre- mium” (RP– RF).We can substitute “R S” for “R P” at the individual stock level and use “R S” as the discount rate in the DDM.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 444\\n\\n14.14 Business Ethics: The Small Investor's Experience of Insider T rading We have just completed a discussion of the elements in securities’ valuation. Some individuals try to get an upper hand in their stock selections by engaging in illegal activi- ties. The following is a salient example. “Insider T rading” has to do with the personal use of mate- rial nonpublic information about the future prospects of a company – whether good or bad, in order to garner an unearned profit by trading its securities ahead of any public announcements regarding the pertinent information. An “insider” is an employee, a relative, or friend of an employee. Insider trading, in the United States, is illegal. Don’ t even think of it. Is such trading, from a moral point of view , fair or not? Is it fair that an insider may have an exploitable advantage to enrich himself/herself? Is the law “correct” in making it illegal? Imagine the scenario below and respond to the questions that follow: Suppose we focus on three parties to a series of transac- tions on a security at a point in time. Mr . X is interested in selling 1,000 shares of ABC corporation; Mr . Y is inter- ested in purchasing 1,000 shares; Mr . Z, an informed cor- porate insider , is interested in purchasing a lar ge block of the stock. Messrs. X and Y are small investors each of whom has personal reasons for engaging in the transaction.445 Kenneth S.Bigel 445\\n\\nIn a normal market, X would sell to Y at the current price. Both parties would be satisfied at having engaged in the transaction. However , Mr. Z holds some critical informa- tion concerning the very favorable portents of the shares and wants to buy before the word gets out. His bid causes the share price to rise and thus Mr . X gets a higher price than he may have otherwise received, all else equal. No harm done. Due to the rise in share price, Mr . Y pays more than he may have otherwise. Such possible harm may be overcome by the pending rise of the shares once the information is announced. The slight short-term harm is overcome by the longer -term profits Mr . Y shall earn. Mr . Y may nonethe- less feel harmed. However , had Mr . X known about the pending release of favorable information, he may have either waited before selling or changed his mind completely about his decision to sell. Mr . X may feel harmed. Questions: 1.Justify Mr . Z’s insider trading on a moral basis. 2.Denounce Mr . Z’s trading – morally speaking. 3.What is your own view of Mr . Z’s trading? Find a moral justification for your position – apart from what you stated already .Introduction toFinancial Analysis 446\\n\\nBottom Line : It is illegal.

Below is a problem whose resolution illustrates the model’ s automatic generation of capital gains.

That is to say that next year ’s price will be greater than last year ’s by 5%, or449 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nthe same as the stock’ s growth rate (again, assuming a con- stant pay-out ratio). We often say that a stock is “ahead of itself,” if the rate of growth in price exceeds the dividend – or earnings – growth rate (assuming a constant pay-out ratio).

A portfolio is a collection of individual securities. If the market values of the portfolio’ s constituent securities were the same, the portfolio weights would be equal, and the simple arithmetic- and weighted-averages would be the same. In calculating the simple arithmetic return, one would take the observed returns and divide by the number of observations. Here, the weights are unequal, so we must employ a weighted average calculation as below . Example : Calculate the (historical or expected) weighted average r eturn for the following portfolio, which consists of three securities (A, B, and C) and has the market values and individual returns as noted.453 Kenneth S.Bigel 453\\n\\nNote : Portfolio risk is notsimply a weighted-average of the portfolio constituents’ respective risks – due to “covari- ance” among securities. Portfolio Return (Solution to Problem) Solution (table form) : Solution (by formula) : RP= 1/6 (.10) + 1/3 (.12) + 1/2 (.16) = 0.1367Introduction toFinancial Analysis 454\\n\\nShort-cut solution : RP= [(100) (.10) + (200) (.12) + (300) (.16)] ÷ 600 = 0.1367 In the short-cut solution, we do not take the weights first. Instead, we multiply the dollar values by each expected return and, at the end, divide by the entire portfolio value. The 0.1367 return means that the investment would increase by 13.67% inone year . If you had invested $1,000, after one year ’s time, you would have one thousand dollars plus $136.70 for a total of $1,136.7. Some of the return, presumably , would come from income (rent, inter- est, or dividends) and some from capital growth (price appreciation). The constituent security returns, as given here, were themselves represented without any further detail as to the breakdown of income and growth portions. If the weights had all been equal (i.e., .3333, in this case), we could have calculated a simple average by adding the sum of the returns and dividing by ( n=) 3. In other words, a simple average implies equal weights. If one of the constituent security’ s returns were negative, we would of course get a dif ferent result. Let us say that the return on Security “A” were -.10, rather than positive. In this case, the portfolio return would be: RP= 1/6 (-.10) + 1/3 (.12) + 1/2 (.16) = .1033455 Kenneth S.Bigel\\n\\nAnother way in which we could have calculated this would have been as follows: 0.1367 – (2) (. 0167) = .1033Introduction toFinancial Analysis 456\\n\\n14.17 The Geometric A verage Return: Multi-y ear Returns Generally , we quote return in annual terms. In order to calculate the return for multiple years, we must arrive at a reasonable, average annual return figure. Suppose you observe the following three (historical or pro- jected) annual returns: .10 .25 .35 The simple, arithmetic average return would be: [.10 + .25 + .35] ÷ 3 = .2333 For the average to be valid in terms of the time value of money , its future value should equal the product of the three observations. However , (1.2333)3≠ (1.10) (1.25) (1.35) Again, the conceptually correct average must be consistent with the time value of money and its “(1 + R)n” format. By modifying the line above and asking what the correct aver- age rate, “R,” should be, we arrive at: (1 + R)3= (1.10) (1.25) (1.35) (1 + R) = [(1.10) (1.25) (1.35)]1/3 R = [(1.10) (1.25) (1.35)]1/3– 1457 Kenneth S.Bigel 457\\n\\nR = .2289 81 Thus, the average multi-period return is 0.2290. This cal- culation is referred to as the “geometric average” and is consistent with the manner in which we do the time value of money . The general notation for this formula requires the use of product summation notation – “Π”(as opposed to using the usual sigma summation notation, Σ). The nota- tion reads as follows: Geometric Average = [Π (1 + R i)1/n] – 1 Question : What would this average be if the 10% observa- tion were negative? Answer : 0.1495. How did you get this? Note : Should there be a negative return in the mix as above, the same method should be used as always. The follow- ing should make common sense. For example, should one experience a 50% loss and a 100% gain in consecutive years, the geometric average return would be: [(1 + {-0.50}) × (1 + 1)]½– 1 = 0.0. Had you instead calculated the simple average, you would have gotten: [(-0.50) + (1.0)] ÷ 2 = 25%. That cannot be correct!Introduction toFinancial Analysis 458\\n\\n14.18 Chapters 12-14: Re view Questions Chapters 12 – 14: Review Questions 1.

TCALM, as it became known, is an advisory group to our institution’ s Provost and President concerning institution-wide strategic initiatives. Thank you Dr . Sokol for your support in this and so many other enterprises. Y ou are my mentor , col- league, and friend. As a member of TCALM, I was privileged to sit through fascinating monthly seminars on multiple subjects deliv- ered by compelling and diverse speakers on a range of top- ics. In the end, my team, consisting of Dr . Barbara Capozzi, and Dr . Jennifer Zelnick, created the T ouro Interdiscipli- nary Institute for Healthy Aging (TIIHA). I wish to thank TCALM management, and especially Drs. Laurie Bobley , Sabra Brock, and Alan Sebel for the fine work they did in designing and implementing the program. In the Fall of 2019, T ouro’ s president, Dr . Alan Kadish ceremoniously awarded me and my new colleagues, Certificates of Com- pletion. It was a privilege and an honor . In the course of my membership in TCALM, I met Sara Tabaei, a fellow member and T ouro Library’ s Information Literacy Director , who introduced me to Open T ouro, an open educational resources (OER) project that she initiated in 2018.

Ms. Jacquelyn Albanese, a student library assistant, complemented Kirk with invaluable pro- duction assistance.

When I joined T ouro University’ s Queens campus (the Lander College for Men), the school had just opened and had few students. The demands on my time were challenging. My then two children were under the age of three and needed paternal attention. I would come home late at night after having completed my classes and they would already be asleep.

Open T ouro aims to reduce the cost of textbooks for students by promoting innovative and equitable open education practices. Open T ouro initially launched through the vision and ef forts of the Library’ s Information Literacy Director , Sara Tabaei , and Open Educational Resources (OER) Librarians Juliana Terciotti Magro, and Geor gia Westbrook. The initiative is currently co-led by Ms. Tabaei , Scholarly Communication & Data Librarian T imothy Valente, and OER & Instruction Librarian, Kirk Snyder , with the help and support of many others across T ouro. Introduction to Financial Analysis by Kenneth S. Bigel, is Open T ouro’ s first original OER publication. Further col- laborations with faculty author Dr .

            "Preface Unique Pedagogical Style This text is written so that the reader can absorb relatively small bytes of information at a time without ever feeling overwhelmed. Each page is short and has a unique topical heading on which the student can focus and easily retain. The paragraphs are kept short, just as you will note they are on this page, to enable the reader to pause, take a breath, and review in his/her mind what s/he just read before going on. Occasionally , concepts and explanation are repeated in consecutive paragraphs in order to present an idea from multiple perspectives and to deepen one’ s comprehension. The writing style attempts to avoid jar gon, except where necessary . In such cases, the terminology is explained so that the reader may proceed with clarity . Still, there are many words and phrases that one must acquire in Finance. At times, vocabulary words are highlighted in the mar gins. Readers are advised to simultaneously press on the “CTRL” and “F” buttons at which time a window will open in which a search word may be entered. This will enable the reader to go back and review concepts at will. The chapters are or ganized and written so that the reader get directly to the point, without unnecessary information and “fluf f.” There is a certain flow to the chapters and sec- tions within the chapters that is intended to make learning smooth and enjoyable.xxiv Kenneth S.Bigel xxiv\n",

            "Concepts and Computations Financial Analysis, by and lar ge, incorporates Accounting concepts. Thus, it is imperative that the analyst understand the numbers, which s/he will utilize in his/her analysis. This text exposes the reader to the many shortcomings in reading Financial Statements. No prior knowledge of Accounting is assumed. The text, in its early chapters, will tenderly lead the reader through the arcane world of Accounting and point out the many shortcomings in read- ing the statements and in conducting elementary Financial Analysis. The reader should have some facility with very basic Alge- bra, in particular , s/he should be able to solve for an unknown in a simple formula, to be able to transpose a value from one side of an equation to the other , and to be to calculate exponents and roots. The text will make Alge- bra easy by showing, where necessary , the correct solutions step-by-step. The text will proceed to Ratio Analysis, the very basic tools of financial analysis, incorporating the previously learned Accounting data. It will then proceed to the notion of the Time V alue of Money , which is the central concept in all of finance. The text will conclude with Stock and Bond V al- uation, which are based on all the previous information of the text. Thus, the reader will build upon his/her knowledge by going from concept to concept in smooth, linear fashion, ever reaching for higher and higher planes of knowledge. <span style=”text-decoration: underline;”The Nuances of Financial Analysis Financial Analysis, at the end of the day , is just common sense, or common business sense.

            "matical principles must conform to the realities of the field and not the other way around. The mathematics are a tool and not an end. In a sense, a financial analyst is bi-lingual; a student will translate financial principles into formulae when advised and can explain in plain English the mean- ing and application of such formulae when first presented with one. It is all supposed to make sense. This book tries to capture this dual and essential nature of Finance. As the reader goes through the text, s/he should increasingly gain a sense of empowerment, confidence, and mastery of the subject. Quotations The text is replete with quotations from an eclectic myriad of sources including the Bible, the T almud, great Greek philosophers, famous politicians, modern and popular thinkers from the 18th century onward, and more. The quo- tations are not intended to postulate or promote a point-of- view , especially where religion is concerned, but instead to inspire the reader to persevere in his/her study , to continue toward the achievement of great heights, and to always consider the social impact of his/her actions. Mastery of Finance presents a person with the opportunity to better oneself in so many ways while simultaneously bettering society-at-lar ge. And that is very cool. Problem-solving In virtually each chapter and ends-of chapters, the reader will find formulae to be solved, tables that need to be filled- in, and occasional diagrams to be drawn. The intent is to make the material come alive so that the student can both learn and test him/herself in the process. Solutions are gen- erally provided to all these fill-ins so that the reader mayxxvi Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

Y ou may have noticed that the Latin word “corpus” seems to appear within it. Indeed, it is a body! It is not human or animal, and it has no physical shape. Y ou cannot see it or touch it. It will have compo- nents that take physical form, such as a building or inven- tory, but the corporation itself is non-corporeal. So, what is it? It is a legal entity . It exists only as a legal construct. As such it is said that the corporation is a “per- son” under the law . It exists in a legal sense. It can be sued. It can be fined. It is owned by people who purchase own- ership interests in it. These interests or “claims” are called “shares” or “stock.” Owners are referred to as “sharehold- ers.” Shareholders have a claim on the company’ s profits. We may thus also refer to this type of corporation as a “stock corporation.” It is in business – generally speaking –Introduction toFinancial Analysis 4 4\n",
            "\n",
            "to make money for its shareholders, although it may serve other more altruistic purposes as well. The corporation, thus, as an independent person, is legally separate from the owners. The corporation may be sued for damages, but the owners may not be – unless the court determines that the owner is somehow legally liable for a wrong-doing himself and apart from the separate actions of the corporation. Therefore, the owners are protected from legal responsibilities. This does not absolve corporate man- agers from legal malfeasance if they did other wrongs, e.g., dumping waste illegally . One downside to the owners is that the corporation itself is a taxable entity . It pays income taxes and then the share- holders, once again, will pay income taxes on any profits distributed to them. These profit distributions are called “dividends.” W e class this “double taxation.” Of course, there are numerous other means by which a company may be or ganized in order to avoid double-tax- ation, but not all will provide the umbrella protection that the corporation provides. Y ou can learn about these busi- ness forms in a Management or T ax course.5Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

Here we shall see. The corporation will have both an “or ganizational struc- ture,” detailing the manner in which the firm actually operates and a capital structure, which is depicted on the Balance Sheet.

Both report to the vice president of finance or chief financial of ficer (CFO). One of the two may also be the CFO, more probably the treasurer . There will be some variance in structure from company to company . The CFO reports to the Chief Operating Of ficer (COO) or to the Chief Executive Of ficer (CEO).

            "1.5 Capital Structure Above, we discussed the firm’ s organizational structure. This is how corporations operate. The firm will also have a “Capital Structure,” which will be represented on its Balance Sheet. The Balance Sheet will consist of Assets, Liabilities and Owners’ Equity . Assets are what the company owns, including inventory , plant and equipment, among other items. Liabilities are what the company owes to others including suppliers and lenders. Equity is the value of what the owners have invested in the company . Companies acquire Capital (Liabilities + Equity) in order to, in turn, “finance” (i.e., pay for) the acquisition and maintenance of its assets. Assets, in turn, are exploited to produce sales, which will – hopefully – deliver profits and a return to the shareholders, who are the owners of the corporation. The basic “accounting equation” is: Assets equals Liabili- ties plus Equity , or A = L + E. A Balance Sheet must, well, balance, as noted here. Assets will be on the left and Liabilities plus equity will be on the right – like the T en Commandments! In general,9Kenneth S.Bigel 9\n",
            "\n",
            "the word “Capital” will refer to the right side of the Bal- ance Sheet. The firm’ s Capital is not free; it has an eco- nomic cost; lenders expect interest on its loans to the company and shareholders expect dividends and the growth of dividends of their equity investment in the firm. The economic cost of the firm’ s capital represents the return to lenders and stock investors. Where there is a return to investors (lenders and owners), there must be a cost to the corporation who provides the return. T wo sides to the same coin. In order to be competitive, a corporation must also cover its “Opportunity Cost.” If an investor in the corporation can earn a better return in an equivalent alternative investment, s/he will choose the better alternative. This is a basic prin- ciple of Economics. The corporation, in order to be able to attract investment, must therefore cover its Opportunity Costs, i.e., the alternative return an investor gives up when making an investment in this corporation. We will discuss the Balance Sheet further in depth on the pages to follow . For now , let’s re-wire our brains so that we think like Financial Economists.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 10\n",

            "Key Terms: Abstract Abstrac- tion Simplifica- tion1.6 Thinking Lik e an Economist: Abstr action Economics, and its of fspring, Finance, are abstract (social) sciences. In order to study economics, it is essential that one understands what an abstraction is. An abstraction is an idea, intended to mir- ror reality in its simplest form. The world is a very complicated place; there are many variables or inputs, some identifi- able, others not, that af fect an outcome, and which we endeavor to identify . In order to understand the outcome which is generally true, but not necessarily absolutely or always so, one must engage in a process of simplification that requires removing minor variables from a general idea in order to reduce the notion to its essential characteristics. Indeed, the Latin word, “abstract,” comes from “drawing” or “taking away from.” The ever -changing kaleidoscope of raw r eality11 Kenneth S.Bigel 11\n",

Thomas Sowell A Conflict of V isions (2002), p. 5 In this process, one is able to derive a broad, general conclusion, based on first principles from which is derived a gen- eral idea or rule. In economics, this requires a ceteris paribus assumption, that is to say , holding “ all else equal .” Initially , it is assumed that no other vari- ables matter and are thus ignored away . It takes some discipline to do this at first, but it quickly becomes easy; you must merely keep it in mind. In circumstances where little given or known information may be at hand, one must assume reasonable default assumptions , i.e., premises , which make sense in general and in the simplest, most com- mon form possible.

            "Dialectical Reasoning Mode of Reasoning Thesis/ Antithesis/ Synthesisimagine other considerations, or variables, that may come into play , one must avoid doing this, in order to focus on just a few key variables, which af fect the outcome. Here is a relevant comment by Dr . Milton Friedman1 : A hypothesis is important if it “explains” much by little, that is, if it abstracts the common and cru- cial elements fr om the mass of complex and detailed circumstances surr ounding the phenomena to be explained and permits valid pr edictions on the basis ofthem alone. To be important, ther efore, a hypoth- esis must be descriptively false in its assumptions; it takes account of, and accounts for , none of the many other attendant cir cumstances, since its very success shows them to be irr elevant for the phenom- ena to be explained…. To be sure, Dr . Friedman’ s comments are not without criticism, but nevertheless are adhered to, by and lar ge, in the social sci- ences, including, of course, economics. In certain other disciplines, including law , political theory , history , philosophy , and possibly others, we do not engage in this mode of r easoning . In these fields, by contrast, we are often engaged in dialec- tical r easoning . There, we first state a thesis , then examine its antithesis . We go back and forth numerous times until we can arrive at a synthesis , which is conclu- sive or dispositive. 1.Friedman, Milton. (1953). Essays in Positive Economics.

            "Descrip- tive Contextual Concrete Generaliz- ableThose of you that are accustomed to dialectical reasoning must diligently avoid the natural instinct to quickly imag- ine the antithesis; rather you must remain steadfast to the line of reasoning demanded by the more linear manner of abstract ar gumentation, based on first principles and ceteris paribus delimitations. (A “delimitation” is a limitation that one person herself imposes on the scope of her reasoning.) When, in certain instances, we deviate from abstract reasoning, we assume spe- cific, more descriptive , circumstances in acontextual or“concr ete” manner . The result may not be generalizable . If a con- clusion is generalizable, we say that it is true in the overwhelming number of instances, although not necessarily all. For instance, it is known via mathematics and reason, that interest rates and stock prices are inversely related. Rates go up, prices go down. This is true beyond any doubt – if we assume ceteris paribus. At the same time, it is more than just interest rates alone that af fect stock prices. One of the beauties of abstract reasoning is that it enables us to employ other , more reasonable assumptions when we find that a model has poor predictive power .

            "1.7 Abstr action: Absurd AND Necessary You thought we were done talking about abstraction. Sorry – one last discussion. It is that important. Here’ s a relevant joke: A chemist, a physicist, and an economist are stranded on a desert island. They have an ample supply of canned food, but alas, no can opener . The chemist suggests that they should light a fire under the cans so that they would burst open. The physicist suggests dropping the cans from the clif f to its rocky bottom to smash them open. The economist declares: “Let’ s assume we have a can opener .” Financial and economic theory makes, what may appear at first, some absurd assumptions. But that is only because the social world, the world inhabited by people, is far more complex, in many ways, than the real world, the world of the hard sciences. Are the chemist’ s molecules motivated by fear and greed? Will ambition or altruism af fect the trajectory of the falling cans?

If you wish to find T imes Square, would you use a map (imagine that there is no GPS or W aze) that details all the streets, or just the main arteries? No!

Finance, as certain other “scientific” subjects, is written in a markedly dif ferent style; it is notably terse and succinct. Words are not parsed, and expansive, colorful prose is con- sistently eschewed. Sparse, precise language is the rule. Unlike literature, for instance, one may find that s/he has to read the same sentence several times until s/he gets it. Y ou just can’ t put your feet up, and slice through many pages in relatively short order . Do not get frustrated when this happens. Kick around the notions discussed in your head, until you get it. Then kick it over again; you may find that you can see the same thing from dif ferent angles with increasing thought. That should invigorate you. Start thinking in Abstract T erms – like a Financial Economist. Spend extra time on each paragraph and page. Y ou may find that you have to substantially slow down the pace of your reading.

            "2.2 The Finance in the Financial Statements Why do we care about Financial Statements in a Finance course? Finance begins where the Certified Public Accoun- tant’s job ends. The accountant’ s job is to carefully exam- ine the company’ s financial records (its “books”) in order first to determine their accuracy and veracity . The accoun- tant will then simplify the data and summarize them into three Financial Statements: The Balance Sheet, The Income Statement, and the Cash Flow Statement. In this text we will deal only with the first two statements. The accountant does not have completely free rein regard- ing the manner in which the financial data are summarized. S/he must abide by “Generally Accepted Accounting Prin- ciples”, also known simply as GAAP . This is the rulebook for the accounting profession. GAAP rules are set by the accounting profession’ s rule-making body , the Financial Accounting Standards Board (F ASB). The accounting pro- fession in turn, derives its legal status from a federal gov- ernment or ganization called the Security and Exchange Commission or “SEC.” By law , the SEC empowers the accounting profession to make its own rules and to police the rules – with the SEC’ s oversight. As many of you may already know , the SEC also oversees the United States’ financial markets. All Financial Statements, including the Balance Sheet, will be provided to lenders who will examine the statements25 Kenneth S.Bigel 25\n",

The skilled financial analyst will then read the statements because s/he is an “interested party ”and wants to know whether an investment in the company is well and fine or whether a potential investment may be advised . S/he may represent lenders or equity shareholders ; either party may be considered “investors. ”Reading the statements requires advanced education concerning how the accoun- tant comp iled the statements. GAAP rules are quite com- plex. In summary , the accountant is a trained historian of sorts. The financial analyst will read the accountant’ s end-prod- uct but is more future oriented. The latter is only concerned about how a potential investment will perform in the future.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 26\n",

            "2.3 The Balance Sheet TheBalance Sheet presents a static, unchanging, still-pho- tograph of a company’ s financial position at a moment in time, i.e., “as of” a certain date, often December 31st. In theory , any of the figures on the balance sheet would be different, either lar ger or smaller , on the very first day fol- lowing (or before) the statement date. The Balance Sheet is usually issued every quarter , i.e., every three months. A very simple balance sheet will look something like the fol- lowing (with the numbers filled in). Take note that any actual Balance Sheet you may examine may dif fer from this simple example. XYZ C orp. Balance Sheet as of 12.31.X X All Asset accounts are “debit balance” accounts. That means that when the account increases (decreases), the amount is recorded on the debit (credit) side of the firm’ s ledger . Liability and Equity Accounts are “credit balance” accounts. We make these entries into the bookkeeper ’s ledger ’s “T -Accounts” (see immediately below). This27 Kenneth S.Bigel 27\n",

            "mechanistic framework is fundamental to “double-entry book-keeping.” Let’s repeat this: Asset accounts are “debit balance” (debit = “Dr”) accounts, whereas liability and owners’ (or share- holders’) equity are “credit balance” (credit = “Cr”) accounts. Increases (decreases) in asset accounts are char- acterized by debit (credit) entries; increases (decreases) in liability and equity accounts are characterized by credit (debit) entries. In “double-entry” bookkeeping, for every debit entry there must be a credit entry . Debits must equal credits, and the balance sheet must balance: T otal Assets = T otal Liabilities + Equity . This is the basic accounting equation. Basic accounting equation : The following equations must, by definition, be true: A = L + E (Assets = Liabilities plus Equity) A – L = E (Assets minus Liabilities = Equity) There are also contra-asset accounts (such as accumulated depreciation and allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables), which are “credit balance” (credit = Cr) accounts. These contra-accounts ef fectively reduce the (net) asset accounts and are credit entries. The phrase “current,” as in “current assets,” has to do with the life of the asset – or liability .

Any asset – or liability – that has a life exceeding one year is “long-term.” Thus, inventory is placed “above the line,” under current assets. So too is the case with accounts payable. Property is long-term, for example. More on this next….29 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

            "2.4 Sample Bookk eeping Entries Here are some examples of simple bookkeeping (or “jour- nal” or “ledger”) entries, exemplifying double-entry book- keeping standards. Keep in mind that assets are debit balance accounts, while liabilities and equity are credit bal- ance accounts. Debits must always equal credits. (All the numbers below are in thousands of dollars.) 1.Let’s say that a company buys inventory for $1,000 in cash. What are the correct bookkeep- ing entries? You will note that cash goes down (credit) and inventory goes up (debit). You will note that the basic accounting equation (A = L + E) remains unchanged. 2.What happens when a company borrows money by issuing long-term debt for $5,000? First, debt increases (credit) and so too will cash (debit).

Thepurchased equity becomes what is called “T reasury Stock,” which is a contra- account and thus a debit balance account. The equity may be reissued again in the future, should the company choose to do so. Another example of a contra-account would be “Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receiv- ables, ”which would be a credit balance account versus accounts receivables. 4.What happens when the company buys $500 in inventory on credit terms? Inventory rises (debit) and payables also increase (credit).31 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

            "2.5 Current Assets: In ventory and Accounts Receivable The accountant defines the word, “current,” as in “current asset” – or “current liability” – as an item, which is con- sumed or exhausted within one calendar year . On the bal- ance sheet, we observe numerous such assets and liabilities. For example, inventory is held by the corpora- tion for sale in the near future and, presumably , is sold in less than one year (in most instances). In fact, the sooner the corporation disposes of its inventory the better , by and large. “Accounts receivable” is a current asset that bears some further explanation. In many instances, a customer pays for goods purchased at the point of sale. He receives the goods (i.e., the corporation’ s inventory) and pays at the same time.That is what usually happens when consumers buy goods at the store. At the time of (a “cash”) sale, the seller reduces inventory (credit) and increases cash (debit). In many , if not most, lar ge business transactions, the cus- tomer may receive the goods, but not pay for them until later. The seller may grant the customer “credit” for the purchase and require “terms of sale” to which the buyer agrees. The terms of sale will dictate that the customer pay for the goods, typically , but not always, within thirty days of delivery . This sale would be referred to as a “credit sale” rather than a “cash sale,” and would be indicated as such on the company’ s income statement (see below).Introduction toFinancial Analysis 32 32\n",
            "\n",
            "At the time of the credit sale, the seller will record, or “book,” an account receivable for the sale on its balance sheet, while the buyer will book an account payable on its. Simultaneously , the seller reduces (i.e., credits) his inven- tory and the buyer increases (i.e., debits) his. When payment is made, the accounts receivable are adjusted (as will the cash account). In the case of the seller , the account receivable is reduced (i.e., credited) and the cash account will be increased (i.e., debited). In the case of the buyer , the account payable will be reduced (i.e., debited) and cash will be reduced (i.e., cred- ited) as well.33 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

            "2.6 Financial Claims Hier arch y Lenders and owners have dif ferent claims on the com- pany’ s interests. There is a distinct hierarchy in which the corporation’ sclaimants get paid – in order from first to last: Debtholders (Lenders) : They get paid first. This includes the interest on loans, and on the loan’ s principal when due. Loan payments are made as contracted, and do not increase should the firm become more profitable. Dividends may not be paid to shareholders unless loan payments have been made first, and in full. Preferred shareholders : These owners (usually) get paid a fixed payment or “dividend,” which cannot increase even if the firm’ s profits increase. If the firm is unable to pay the dividend it may skip it. However , most preferred dividends are “cumulative,” which means that no common stock div- idends may be paid unless and until all past unpaid divi- dends that have accumulated “in arrears” are paid in full first. Common shareholders : These shareholders get their divi- dends last, and are ef fective owners of any earnings, which the firm does not pay out, but “retains” and reinvests back into the firm in the manner of added property , plant, equip- ment, and working capital. In other words, common share- holders have a claim on the firm’ s net income (after preferred dividends have been paid).Introduction toFinancial Analysis 34 34\n",
            "\n",
            "Common shareholders take on the most risk as they are last ones “on the totem pole.” Such is the case whether the firm is an ongoing enterprise or is being liquidated in bankruptcy . They get paid last. Common shareholders have a “residual” claim, or interest, in the company – after all other interests are taken care of. On the other hand, the common shareholders have the most to gain if the firm is profitable; the dividend may be increased and more earnings may be retained – to their financial benefit, as the firm’ s “retained earnings” are owned by the common shareholders. Again, only common shareholders benefit if profits go up; common share ownership entails more risk, since if interest and preferred dividends are not paid, there may be nothing left for the common shareholders. Government and T axes: Let’ s not for get that, after interest has been paid, the earnings of the company are then taxed, and that dividends are paid out of Net Income – after taxes have been paid. T axes are a given, and normally , we do not think of the government as a claimant on the firm, since it is neither lender nor owner . Nothing is certain except death and taxes. -Benjamin Franklin35 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

            "2.8 Bankruptcy Many students think that bankruptcy is a death knell. It is not – necessarily . It can actually be a good thing, which ensures the survival of an enterprise that experienced finan- cial stress. There are dif ferent forms of bankruptcy . The forms are categorized by “chapters,” under T itle 1 1 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Let’ s briefly see what the principal bankruptcy forms are, as noted in the Code by chapter , and how each form is dif ferent. Chapter 7 : This bankruptcy form allows debtors to eliminate most or all of their debts over a short period of time, often just a few months. Only student loans, child support payments and some other debts may survive. Here, atrustee is appointed who then liquidates unsecured debts and makes the proper distributions. Collateral on secured debt may berepossessed. Certain assets will be protected, such as social security insurance. T o qualify for Chapter 7, the debtor must satisfy a “means test.” If the test is not satis- fied, the debtor may seek relief under Chapter 13. Chapter 1 1: Here, the debtor retains ownership and control of assets. The debtor is referred to as a “debtor in possession.” The “DIP” runs the day-to-day af fairs of the business while the creditors work with the bankruptcy court to work out a plan to be made whole. If the creditors come to an agreement,39 Kenneth S.Bigel 39\n",
            "\n",
            "the business continues operating and certain agreed-upon payments are made. If there is no agreement, the court intercedes; debtors filing a second time are referred to as Chapter 22 filers. Chapter 13 : In this form, debtors retain ownership and possession of the assets (in contrast to Chapter 7), andwill make payments to a trustee from future earnings ,which will then be dis- bursed to creditors. There is a five-year limit in which this process must be completed . Secured creditors may receive larger payments. Students’ take-away :Bankruptcy is not always the end of the story . Advice :One should consult with an attorney to obtain detailed, actionable information regarding these complex laws. Question :In the Banking Crisis of 2008, the United States government rescued, or bailed out, General Motors; it purchased stock in the company , using taxpayer funds. W as that the right move? W ould it have been better for Uncle Sam to have allowed the corporation to fail and file under the Bankruptcy Code?Introduction toFinancial Analysis 40\n",

            "2.9 The Balance Sheet, Net Income, and the Common Shareholder Net income is an Income Statement number , which is also very relevant to the balance sheet. What happens to net income –or profits –after it is recorded? Let’ s say the company records net income of $1million for the year . If the company pays dividends to its shareholders of, say $100,000, those funds are now theirs and not the corporation’ s. The shareholders are enriched to the extent of $100,000 (less taxes). This leaves $900,000 in “addition to retained earnings,” which at the year ’s end will be transferred by the accoun- tantfrom the income statement to the retained earnings account in the equity section of the balance sheet. (This is done when the accountant “closes out the books” at year ’s end, at which time the income statement reverts to zero.) Of course, as owners of the corporation, all retained earnings, in fact, belong to the common shareholders as well. Thus, from the point of view of the balance sheet, the common shareholders own both the “common stock” and the “retained earnings.” The preferred shareholders justown the preferred stock. 41 Kenneth S.Bigel 41\n",
            "\n",
            "2.10 Corpor ate Goals It is well known that in a Capitalist economy , the corpora- tion is said to serve the interests of the owners. (While there may be additional purposes, we shall assume this simple premise.) The owners wish to earn prof- its,to“make money .”In theory , we shall assume that the owners and, by extension, the corporation has a never - ending appetite for profits and corporate growth. W e shall say that the corporation has no interest in vacation, rest, or“doing good,” the lack of which premises may , in fact, befalse. “Growth,” thus, refers to the increase in a corporation’ s sales or revenues, which in turn provide increasing levels of profits to the benefit of the corporation’ s owners. This brings us to the Balance Sheet. No company can produce sales without assets. It is assets (the left side of the Balance Sheet) that produce goods and services for sale. However , assets must be paid for , or more accurately , “financed” when cash itself is unavailable. The financing of the company’ s assets comes from raising capital in the form of liabilities, including borrowed money ,and injections of cash from owners who purchase shares of equity in the corporation when such shares areoffered by the corporation. (This is distinctly dif ferent from secondary market trading where shares are bought from selling shareholders with no corporate involve- ment.) Financing sources also include profits which the company retains – “Retained Earnings.”Introduction toFinancial Analysis 42 42\n",
            "\n",
            "As the company increases its capital, it is then equipped to acquire more assets with which to increase its sales and profits ad infinitum. Thus, as the balance sheet itself increases, so too does the potential for corporate growth as we define it. Round and round she goes.43 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

            "2.11 W ords and Numbers (An Aside ) In business and perhaps in Finance in particular , memoriza- tion is less important than active, creative thinking. Some people find math intimidating, but it does not have to be. By and lar ge, Finance does not require the memorization of formulas. However , one must understand the mathematics. This is an important distinction. If you regard formulas as memorization, it may become an unpleasant and, worse, a dif ficult task. Instead, think of formulas as shorthand explanations of the relationships between important finan- cial concepts, between prices and interest rates, for exam- ple. If this is done, the relationships will seem clear and logical, and memorization should prove unnecessary , or at least, less so. Some people consider themselves word- rather than num- ber-persons. Think of numbers as words! Indeed, they are linguistically meaningful. Mathematical symbols are a shorthand way of saying something that can also be said – at greater length – in words.

            "3.2 The Income Statement Income statements, in contrast to the balance sheet, are “flow” statements, and are thus not static like the balance sheet; think of it instead as a moving picture, rather than as a photograph. The income statement will reflect cumula- tive data for a period ending on a certain date. The “period” has a starting and ending date; it may cover a year , half- year, quarter , or even a month. Over the course of the period, the numbers, whether they be revenues or expenses, will grow only lar ger. The sole exception to this is the profit figures, including gross prof- its, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and net income. These data may go either up or down depending on the relative growth of the revenues and expenses that make up those “net” figures. That is, if revenues grew less than expenses over a period, the net profit may go down over time. T ake note that expenses are bracketed numbers to indicate that they are subtractions from revenue in order to arrive at profits. Again, all other entries are the result of the accountant’ s summarization of revenue and expense bookkeeping entries, which only grow in size over time (with some few exceptions). Profits are merely the calculation of dif- ferences between revenues and expenses in the summary income statement. If expenses grow faster than revenues, profits may decrease in time. In contrast, balance sheet numbers will change, in theory ,51 Kenneth S.Bigel 51\n",

At the year ’s end, the “books are closed” and all the income statement numbers revert to zero; we start all over again. The balance sheet, in contrast, never reverts to zero; the company always has some assets and liabilities. A very simple income statement will look something like the following: XYZ Corp. Income Statement for the Y ear Ending 12.31.XX You must note that expenses are brack- eted as they are reductions (subtractions) to revenue in arriving at the profits num- bers, i.e., Gross Profits, EBIT , and Net Income. The key connection between the income statement and balance sheet has lar gely to do with “addition to retained earnings.” When the books are “closed” at year ’s end, this addition (or deduction) is trans- ferred to “retained earnings” in the bal-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 52\n",

            "ance sheet; the income statement is “closed out,” and everything in the income statement reverts back to zero. If dividends are paid when there is a loss, the cash used to pay the dividends will have to come from (past years’) retained earnings. “Retained earnings” represent the accu- mulation of historically retained profits, which were not paid out as dividends, but instead were retained by the cor- poration, since the corporation’ s inception. As an accountant (or financial analyst), you may think of revenues as credits (right hand) and expenses as debits (left hand) of the “T -accounts” to which reference was made in the prior chapter . Think of the income statement as part of the balance sheet’ s equity section, which is also a credit balance account. When numbers are compared to a base figure, in this case either “total revenues” or “Net Income,” the analysis may be referred to as “V ertical Analysis.” This makes the analysis from one company to another sim- pler. Matters having to do with the relative magnitude of the data from one company to another are thereby neu- tralized. Such analysis utilizes Common Size Statements , where figures are represented in percentage terms, as in the income statement above. Common size statements are also (very occasionally) used for Balance Sheets. Getting back to debits and credits, at year ’s end, the accountant debits the income statement for an amount equal to the “addition to retained earnings.” Remember that the Income Statement is a credit balance statement. This debiting enables the accountant to set the income state- ment back to zero. (Again, the balance sheet never reverts to zero, except in the extreme case of bankruptcy liquida- tion.) S/he then credits the balance sheet’ s retained earn- ings account for this same amount. That is how retained53 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",
            "Credit Sales S, G, & Aearnings grow (or decrease when there is a loss and retained earnings are thus negative) over time. The addi- tions to earnings should be reinvested by a good manage- ment in profitable assets for corporate growth purposes. “EBIT” may also be referred to as “operating earnings.” As you will see, we will dif ferentiate between operating earnings, i.e., earnings generated from the firm’ s business activities, and other non-operating income. There are a few other basic things that the financial analyst must keep in mind relative to the Income Statement. Credit sales (on the income statement) are recorded as accounts receivable (on the balance sheet) – until the receivables are collected. This is typical of accrual accounting, as opposed to cash account- ing, the latter of which recognizes a sale only when cash is exchanged. At the time of a credit sale, credit sales are “credited” on the books, and accounts receivable are debited. When the customer pays, say in 30 days, the account receivable is credited and the cash account is debited. Selling expenses include advertising, salesperson’ s salaries, and “freight-out” paid on shipments to customers; an excep- tion is “freight-in” payments, which are paid on shipments to the firm and are included in COGS (cost of goods sold). General and administrative expenses have to do with: clerical and executive of fices salaries, outside professional services, tele- phone and internet, postage, and of fice equipment depreci-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 54\n",

            "Deprecia- tion Imputableation. Selling, General, and Administrative expenses are also known as S, G, & A . Depr eciation , ifimputable to inventory production, will be included in COGS. By “imputable,” it is meant that the accoun- tant can objectively ascribe a specified dollar amount of depreciation to a speci- fied dollar amount of production. Imputable means that units produced can be associated and measured with mathe- matical certainty and precision to units of production. This figure would be added to COGS, rather than reported separately lower down on the Income Statement. For example, if an equipment manufacturer warrants that a $1 million-dollar machine (at cost) will produce one mil- lion units and then need to be scrapped, we can safely say that each unit produced includes one dollar ’s worth of depreciation. This may happen in the case of depreciable equipment, but not with the plant. Otherwise, i.e., if not imputable, depreciation will be reflected separately and visibly below the gross profit line. This makes matters confusing to the reader .Depreciation may be included “above” (within COGS) and/or “below” the gross profits line (as “depreciation expense”). If the for- mer, it will be included within theCOGS number; if not, it should be reflected as a separate line item lower down the income statement.55 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",
            "EBIT Operating EarningsEBIT orOperating Earnings should be viewed as a kind of dividing line within the income statement. Everything “above the line,” has to do with the firm’ s basic running of the business, or operating rev- enues and expenses. Those items that appear “below the line” may include numerous non-operating items. Such items may include interest on debt, a profit or loss from the sale of an asset, or the financial outcome of litigation. Inter- est (on debt) has to do with a financial matter; this is not a matter having to do with the running of the business, but instead, with the decision as to how the firm’ s assets are financed, in this case with debt rather than with equity . Analytically , it is important to the financial analyst to dif ferentiate between operating and non-operat- ing; we shall depend on this dif ferentiation often. Taxes are based on earnings before taxes (EBT), which are not always shown on income statements as a separate line item. Here, EBT , i.e., EBIT ($4,500) less interest expense ($500), but before taxes, equals $4,000. Y ou should also note that taxes were calculated using a 30% tax rate (i.e., a rate arbitrarily chosen for this example), i.e., $4,000 × 30% = $1,200.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 56\n",

            "3.4 Financial Statements: Interpretation Financial Statements are fraught with interpretive prob- lems , due to accrual accounting methods, emanating from historical bias, arbitrary choice of one or another cost method ,and the use of estimates and reserves , all of which arelegitimate applications of “generally accepted account- ing principles.” The lar ger the corporation, the more sus- ceptible its financial statements are to misleading data for the financial analyst to decipher and comprehend. Accounting presentations complicate analysis, and in par- ticular make dif ficult the use of analytic financial ratios , which are compiled from the accounting data .Hence, financial analysis is not straightforward, as it would other- wise be if the numerical bases of the accounting data were themselves not subject to variation over time and from firm to firm, an dthus to – interpretation! Historical bias –In most, but not all cases, asset cost is recorded by the accountant based on invoiced ,historical values .Such costs are determined at a point in time and are not adjusted upward later for changing , and possibly increasing, market val ues. (These assets may then be depreciated, adding still further to the dif ficulty in interpre- tation.) For example, in the case of long-term assets, a building may be built (or purchased )at a(historical) costof $1 mil- lion dollars. Another , virtually identical building, whichIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 60 60\n",
            "\n",
            "may be built (or purchased ) by the same company some years later could have a cost of $2 million; the newer building costs more due to inflation and/or market condi- tions. The accountant will not necessarily show the details of the original costs of each property and the respective depreciation schedules for each property separately . The accountant will carry the building ’svalue at its original cost,and at a combined sum, in this case of $3 mil- lion, leaving the reader of the data with a kind of mixed bag of information. Secondly , thedepreciation expense will be based on this original value. Market values of buildings often , in fact, exceed therecorded, “book ”carrying values , i.e., historical cost minus accumulated depreciation .The accountant will not adjust the carrying value of such an asset upward ,thereby makingit dif ficult to know the asset’ s,andtherefore the company’ s,true worth. This is not an issue where current assets are concerned. It certainly does not apply to cash or accounts receivable; these values do not change. (Under certain narrowly defined circumstances, cash equivalents, a.k .a., “mar- ketable securities” values may be adjusted.) Inventory is generally not marked down in value and never marked up, under accounting rules. Estimates –This toowill be illustrated (below) with the use of the(same )example of long-term asset accounting . We will examine both the asset’ s “ salvage value ”andtheasset ’sestimated “ life,”both of which are estimated. This leaves ample room for “judgment” and , hence, earnings manipulation. Other examples may also pertain.61 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",
            "Reserves –For example, management has some leeway in setting up loss accounts or“reserves ,”e.g., for “uncol- lectible accounts receivable ,”better known as “allowance for doubtful accounts.” We will not demonstrate this phe- nomenon; suf fice it to say that this is a notable problem where accounting “manipulation” is concerned. While reserves have been listed here as a category by itself, the reader may also think of it as an example of an estimate. Arbitrary use of cost or other methods – The accountant (together with company management) has alternatives regarding themanner in which s/hemay choose to “cost” certain items. This will be illustrated (below) with respect to inventory (a “current asset”) and long-term asset accounting, including plant and equipment. Y ou must recall that “property ,” i.e., land cannot be depreciated. An external financial analyst must dig below the surface inorder to understand the accountant’ s summary of the corporation ’s ledgers. He must also have a deep under- standing of the nature of the industry in which the cor- poration operates .A good place to start is by reading the accountant’ s footnotes and thoroughly understanding the firm’ sGAAP reporting policies. “GAAP” refers to “gener- ally accepted accounting principles,” which are the rules to which accountants must adhere.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 62\n",

            "3.5 The Audit Now that we know what financial statements are, and what set of problems may ensue in readings statements, it is important to know well what the accountant’ s role relative to the production of the statements is. Certified Public Accountants (C.P.A.s) examine , i.e., “audit,” the books , ledgers, and records of corporations in order to ascertain the data entries’ veracity and accuracy ,andprepare sum- mary financial statements such as those we have seen in ourBalance Sheet andIncome Statement discussions .The statements are , once again, summaries of myriad , and often complex, transactions that occurred within the corporationover the course of the stated period – for the Income Statement, or“as of ”a date noted – in the case of the Balance Sheet. The auditors will present one of four possible “opinions” about the statements. The analyst should examine the opin- ion for information concerning the accuracy and compre- hensiveness of the statements’ data prior to reading the statements themselves. 1.Unqualified Opinion: This is the ideal opinion and is considered a “complete audit.” The results are satisfactory , and the statements are “fairly presented” in the language of the auditor/ accountant. 2.Unqualified Opinion with Explanatory Para- graph: This may be a complete audit, but the auditor believes that additional information is63 Kenneth S.Bigel 63\n",
            "\n",
            "required. 3.Qualified Opinion: In general, the statements are fairly presented with an important exception that does not af fect the statements as a whole. This generally occurs when there is an unjusti- fied deviation from “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,” or GAAP . This opinion falls short of “Adverse.” 4.Adverse Opinion: The auditor does not feel that the statements taken as a whole fairly pre- sent the corporation’ s financial position in con- formity with GAAP accounting.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 64\n",

            "3.6 P erpetual In ventory Accounting There are two such counting (“Accounting”) methods for inventory – “perpetual” and “periodic.” Aperpetual inven- tory counting system is usually used where the inventory units are few in number ,and high in unit cost. It thus pays for the firm’ s management to spend some extra resources in knowing exactly how many yachts , for example, it has in the showroom. A one-unit dif ference is substantial. Under this system, the firm knows –at all times –the dollar value of its inventory .There are certain method sunder which a perpetual system accounts for its inventory ,includ- ing“specific identification, ”whereby each physical inventory unit is associated with its own specific cost. In contrast, a periodic inventory system is effective where units are numerous and relatively cheap. Manage- ment is not going to be able to justify the extra ef fort required to know whether there are ten or eleven blue pens instock, more or less . It will do, instead, a periodic , prob- ably annually , physical audit of what’ s down there in the warehouse. When a physical audit is done, the counting is done in units, rather than in dollars. Thus, the ascription of units to dollars is subject to methodological choice. When a company uses a periodic system, there are manage- ment choices under legitimate accounting rules by which the accountant may record the ending inventory balance and, hence, cost of goods sold figures – in dollars . Wewill illustrate all this below .Upon the completion of which65 Kenneth S.Bigel 65\n",

            "analysis, the analyst’ s relevant interpretive issues should become clear .

            "3.7 P eriodic In ventory Analysis: Ending Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold Let’s assume a company’ s books reflect the following accounting data: We know the beginning inventory dollar figure because it is carried over from the prior period’ s end ing value as noted on the Balance Sheet . The purchasing manager will have loads of invoices (bills) for all the purchases made in the period, so that figure is also known. Adding beginning inventory and purchases together , we get the total amount of goods that were available for sale during the period. If we subtract the ending inventory from the goods available number , we get the “cost of goods sold ,”which will be noted on the Income Statement. How do we know what the dollar value of the ending inventory is if we are not using a specific identification- type inventory accounting system? When the inventory manager conducts a monthly , or periodic, physical audit, s/hecounts inventory units and not dollars. How does the accountant translate units into dollars for valuing the end- ing inventory ?67 Kenneth S.Bigel 67\n",

            "3.8 Units to Numbers: FIFO and LIFO If most businesses “do” inventory periodically (rather than perpetually )for practical reasons, by quite liter- ally,physically counting (ending) inventory units , usually monthly , how does the accountant translate the ending inventory units counted into dollars? As we shall see below , management and its accountants have ample dis- cretion regarding choice of inventory costing method. In the following illustration for the two most popular cost- ing methods , the company has started the year with oneunit of inventory carried at a cost of $100. Y ou will note that the costs go up in time, reflecting an inflationary environment. It is also assumed that only one identical inventory item is being counted. Alternate Solutions to the Ending Inventory Pr oblem In the chart below , you will find alternate solutions to the Ending Inventory Problem when the accountant employs either of two popular costing methods: FIFO (First In, First Out) and LIFO (Last In, First Out). A detailed step-by-step explanation of the chart is found on the next page. Before flipping to the next page, see if you are able to decipher69 Kenneth S.Bigel 69\n",
            "\n",
            "the table on your own. Immediately following the table is a discussion of the dif fering results of the two methods. You will note that the choice of method materially af fects the Cost of Goods Sold and Ending Inventory values, and therefore all the other values in the table as well. Clearly , a firm will adopt LIFO if it wishes to reduce inflated, “windfall ”profits ,andhence taxes ,in an infla- tionary environment. LIFO will consequently reduce inventory assets on the balance sheet and make relevant ratios ,and hence loan prospects ,possibly less attractive to banks who wish to see more assets against which loans may be made and, possibly , secured. Management and its accountants have to weigh the of fsetting considera- tions ofone or the other costing method. Take note that inventory is part of current assets and “working capital” (WC). WC = Current Assets less Current Liabilities.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 70\n",

            "3.9 In ventory Costing Calculations: A Closer L ook at the COGS and Ending Inventory Computations First, it must be recognized that the sales amount is inde- pendent of any costing method. For every sale, there is an invoice, and the dollar amount is not at all subject to any choice of accounting inventory costing method. Under FIFO, the first- in were assumed to be the first- out. So, the cost of goods sold (COGS) figure was the sum of the first four (since four units were sold) costs: $100 + 150 + 200 + 250 = $700. The income statement will show a $700 COGS number as a deduction from sales to arrive at the gross profit of $2,000 –700 = $1,300. This left $300 in the ending inventory on the balance sheet. Notice that $700 + 300 = $1,000 or the entire inventory cost. Under LIFO, we must take the last-in ,first-out order to compute the sum of the units sold and to arrive at the COGS number . Therefore, we add in reverse chronological order: $300 + 250 + 200 + 150 = $900. The ending inven- tory will be the first unit acquired, costing $100. Again, the two numbers add up to the sum of the inventory cost: $100 + 900 = $1,000. Gross profits will be lower: $2,000 – 900 = $1,100. T axes are based on profits. In an inflationary environment, taxes payable will therefore be lower . Assuming inventory costs rise as often happens when there is inflation , FIFO will always produce a higher gross profit.71 Kenneth S.Bigel 71\n",
            "\n",
            "When corporations expect high inflation (as occurred in the 1970s and in the early 2020s), many will switch to LIFO in order to reduce taxes. Companies pay higher taxes when profits are higher , as might be the case using FIFO , assum- ing all else equal .To switch to LIFO, the firm must com- plete IRSForm 970 . The corporation cannot go back and forth from one method to the other as the wind blows. Y ou will find the form on the Internet. The company will prefer LIFO to reduce taxes. It will pre- fer FIFO to report higher inventory levels and thus show “more” assets to lenders and shareholders. W ell, which of the two is preferable in the end? It is permissible for the company to maintain two sets of books, one for filing taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) and the other for “reporting.” Moreover , it can use varying methods for dif- ferent inventory items – FIFO for this and LIFO for that. How do you like that?! Once again, a company may use one inventory costing method for one inventory item, and a dif ferent method for another item. In the end, the various items will be lumped together on one inventory line on the Balance Sheet and reflected as such in COGS . There might be a footnote indicating that inventory was valued using both FIFO and LIFO (and perhaps still another method), but further details may be absent. T alk about confusing!Introduction toFinancial Analysis 72\n",

            "Key Terms:3.10 In ventory Accounting Issues: LIFO Of course, the previous example was “loaded” in that pur- chase costs rose dramatically over time . In reality , prices tend often to rise with inflation, so the direction of the results in actuality would notbeaffected .If,in fact ,costs declined over the considered periods, the direction of the results would be exactly reversed, and your choice of method, if you anticipated this alternate outcome, would be dif ferent accordingly .Here are some relevant upcoming questions. 1.What is meant by “LIFO Base”? 2.What is the ef fect of costing units sold from the base? 3.There is a technical problem in connection with interim reporting under LIFO (in FIFO too). Using the foregoing example, imagine that the firm –indef- initely into the future –regularly purchased four units and sold four units. Imagine also that there continued to be some inflation. A firm cannot accurately provide its LIFO inventory figure until it closes the books on the period. More specifically , the firm cannot figure the Cost of Goods Sold, and therefore its LIFO inventory until it has, quite literally , made the last73 Kenneth S.Bigel 73\n",
            "\n",
            "LIFO baseinventory purchase and thus knows the costs ofunits acquired. It would be conceivable that after some time, inventory costs and sales prices would be quite high, say $20 per unit – theoretically . Still, that one very “old” unit, which is being carried at ahistorical (ancient!) cost, would reflect a very low “cost basis” of, say $1, representing the inventory’ s LIFO Base . (See the example on the next page.) If many years later ,the firm suddenly then sold five units, it would dig into or “cost out” its LIFO base and reflect a very high profit for that item. This now high profit on that unit would be contrary to the firm’ s motivation for adopting LIFO in the first place, which is to minimize profits and conse- quent lyitstax liabilities. By example, let’ s say the firm is on a calendar year fiscal cycle. It cannot know in the interim, say , in Novem- ber,what the December year-end inventory shall be. In our earlier case, the fourth unit purchased is the firstout andfirstcharged to COGS. The third acquired is the sec- ond to go,etc. W e count backwards starting with the last one in! We cannot know what the last one’ s cost is – until the last one isin!(True, this problem pertains to FIFO, but is less worrisome analytically .) An illustration of this prob- lem follows on the next page. Note : You should be aware that Cost of Goods Sold represents the cost of inventory , which passes through the income state-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 74\n",

            "ment when sales are recognized, and includes raw materi- als, “imputable” labor and depreciation, freight-in, and pos- sibly more. “Imputable” refers to measurable costs that can – with certainty – be related to production, in addition to the otherwise explicit inventory costs. Suppose you have a widget making machine, which costs $1,000,000 and the manufacturer warrants that it has an expected life of producing one million units, after which it must be scrapped. Under this circumstance, the cost accountant may impute $1 of depreciation to each unit of inventory . Otherwise, depreciation would be shown separately , i.e., lower down on the income statement, as illustrated in the sample income statement earlier .75 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

            "3.11 LIFO Base Illustr ation XYZ Corp. costs its inventory on a LIFO basis due to the cost and price inflation its product continuously manifests. In the first year illustrated, let’ s call it “20X1,” the com- pany purchased 5 units. It sold 4 units, leaving the oldest unit to be carried forward as the LIFO Base Inventory to the next year , “20×2.” See the table below . Each year going forward, it continues to purchase 4 units and sell 4 units. Therefore, the LIFO Base, initially costed at $1, carries over until “20×5.” The revenue the company receives equals the average of the last price in the current and prior years. The last price, i.e., the price at which the last unit was sold, in “20X0” was $2. Due to the high LIFO costing method, the gross profits remain low , thereby min- imizing taxes. Had it done its inventory on a FIFO basis, its gross profits would have been slightly higher . (You can figure this out.) In the year , 20×5, the company sells all 5 units that were available for sale. The last unit sold was at a price of $22 and its cost, based on LIFO, was only $1. The company would therefore book a high, “windfall” profit on that unit, contrary to the intent of LIFO, which is to keep (taxable) profits low .Introduction toFinancial Analysis 76 76\n",
            "\n",
            "The purpose of using LIFO Inventory Accounting is to reduce gross profits and thus taxes. W e have seen that sell- ing product from the LIFO Base will negate this objective. To avoid this problem, management should order a 6th unit in 20×5 so that the LIFO Base is not costed out. In doing so, management is “manipulating” the ef fect of its inven- tory costing method. Remember , this is accounting fiction in the sense that the costs are unrelated to the actual age of the units. A good merchandiser would have long ago moved out any product that is subject to physical aging.77 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

There is an entirely dif ferent set of meth- ods required for tax accounting , which we shall not cover herewith .The following methods are unacceptable for T ax accounting. The first method we shall outline iscalled “straight line.” Under this method, we expense on the income statement the same amount of depreciation each year . If, for instance, the asset is estimated to have a five-year life, as in this example, we shall depreciate 1/5 or 20% of the asset yearly. This ratio will be applied against (i.e., multiplied by) the dif ference between the property’ shistorical cost and its estimated salvage value. (Note the key word: “esti- mated ,”which is used here for thesecond time. ) Herein we shall refer to this dif ference in the two numbers as the “depreciable amount,” a phrase, which we use here , butwhich you shall not find popularly used elsewhere. Let’s assume the following:Introduction toFinancial Analysis 78 78\n",
            "\n",
            "As you read this and the next two examples, remember that “Salvage V alue” does not apply to buildings but only to equipment. Also remember that property , i.e., land, cannot be depreciated. In “year zero,” which means “now” (see table below), the asset shall be carried on the balance sheet at its original, historical cost of $1,500,000. Each subsequent year , we shall depreciate 1/5, or 20% of the dif ference between the cost and the salvage value, this dif ference being: $1,500,000 – $500,000 = $1,000,000. Thus, the deprecia- tion expense is: $1,000,000 ÷ 5 = $200,000 each year . As the asset balance is depreciated on the balance sheet and the depreciation is expensed on the income statement, the carrying balance of the asset is reduced by $200,000 each year , until – after five years in this case – the build- ing or equipment is sold for its estimated salvage value. Should the asset be sold for more or less than its salvage value, the accountant will record an “unusual” or “non- recurring” profit or l oss accordingly . 79 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

            "3.14 Acceler ated Depreciation Methods: Sum-of-the- Years' Digits (F or reporting purposes only) There are two more methods, which we shall examine, both of which may be referred to as “accelerated ”depreci- ation methods because in the early years there will be more depreciation expense than in the la ter years. You’ll remember that the ratio we used in the given exam- ple for St raight Line was 20% .Under “Sum-of-the-years’ digits” (SOYD), we apply a new ratio against the $1,000,000 depreciable amount. In the denominator for the SOYD ratio, we calculate the sum of the year s’digits, which ,in this five-year exam- pleis: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15. In the numerator , we use the reverse order of the years ,starting with five,andthen go ing backwards each year. So, in year one, we expense 5/15 of $1,000,000 = $333,333, and reduce the balance accordingly .In the sec- ond year the ratio is 4/15. In the third, year the ratio is 3/15, or, as it happens, the same 20% that we used in the straight- linemethod; you’ll note that the depreciation expense after thisthird year will be less than under straight-line. At this rate, you will note that after five years we will have depre- ciated 15/15 or 100% of the depreciable amount.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 82 82\n",

            "3.15 Acceler ated Depreciation Methods: Double/Declining Balance (For reporting purposes only) Under Double /Declining Balance (D/DB), we combine two concepts, hence the slash in the name. That’ s the way to remember what this method is about. First of all , we depreciate at double the straight-line rate, which in this case, would be 2 × 2 0%,or 40% per year . If we do this doubling of the annual rate, we would have depreciated the entire asset in half the asset’ sesti- mated life, rather than in the full five years; or alternatively , we would have depreciated twice the asset’ s original costover the entire five years. Either alternative is clearly incorrect and una cceptable . Instead, we depreciate twice the straight-line rate, not against the depreciable amount, but against the declining balance , ignoring salvage value. That’ s the second con- cept: the use of a declining balance. So, in the first year , we depreciate 40% of $1,500,000 ,or $600,000, leaving a new balance of $900,000. In the second year , we depre- ciate 40% of the declining balance of $900,000, which is $360,000. In this example (and not necessarily in all examples), if we continue to depreciate at this rate, we will go below the salvage value in the third year . At this point ,the account antwill either depreciate the balance of $40,000 inIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 84 84\n",

D/DB is even more accelerated than SOYD, as you may have already noticed. The depreciation expense is greater in the early years .

Analysts rely mightily on accounting data. Thus, we must know what is going on in the corporate accounting world. Reported earnings are subject to all kindsof accounting chicanery , and it is earnings that largely drive stock prices ! Thus, firms have an incentive to “manage earnings” in order to guide analysts’ earnings expectations downward and, thereby , report actual earnings that were greater than analysts’ previous consensus expectations. Corpora- tions cannot legally inform analysts what their exact earn- ings expectations are, so they emplo y various mechanisms to guide the analysts. Stock prices, in the wake of this management, will react 1.This section is based on Li, S., & Moore, E.A. (201 1).

            "Key Terms:bullishly to positive earnings announcements, i.e., earnings that exceed expectations. Such stocks will provide higher returns than those of firms who do not beat expectations,2 as investors may believe that beating expectations signals positive trends in future earnings. Stocks of corporations that miss expected earnings are penalized asymmetrically; markets penalize stocks more for missed earnings than they reward companies for positive surprises.3 Not all potentially misleading accounting data are inten- tionally “managed” by the firm and its accountants. In some cases, GAAP accounting provides no discretionary opportunities for earnings management ,e.g., the choice of either FIFO or LIFO, yet the data may nonetheless not rep- resent true values . An example that we discussed had to do with historical bias. In this case, there is only one way in which a long-term asset can be “booked, ”and hence its reported asset and tax depreciation figures are based on that historical cost. The historical record is unlikely to be realistic. Beyond these examples, inventory can be written down on a discretionary basis within reasonable limits. Reported esti- mates and reserves can be manipulated within reasonable parameters. Indeed, reserves are fertile ground for manipula- tion. In order to manage earnings upward, the firm may choose to “under -reserve” 2.Bartov E., D. Givoly and C. Hayn. 2002. The rewards to meeting or beating earnings expectations.

As noted, managed manipulation of accrual accounting methods will lead to varying presentations of the same economic phe- nomena. AEM, thus, involves the use of the accounting system itself in order toinfluence a desired result.On the other hand, we have also provided some illus- trations of Accrual Earnings Manage- ment (AEM ) in the manner of Inventory Costing andReported Depreciation Accounting Methods (as opposed to tax depreciation methods). AEM has to do with GAAP -permitted choices. Timing the sale of inventory in order to boost earnings in a tar geted period. Another opportunity for earnings man- agement comes from Real Earnings Management (REM ).In this case, a firm may engage in certain actual transac- tions in order to accomplish a particular accounting outcome. Specifically , the firm could structure transactions by set- ting them at varying discretionary points in time (“timing”) in order to achieve a pre-set accounting result. Here are some examples of REM: 1.Delaying fixed asset maintenance expenses. 2.Delaying operating expenses, including adver- tising and R&D. 3.Putting of f salary increases and the payment of bonuses.99 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

Third, firms have a nincentive to manage the public’ s future earn- ings expectations in such manner as ana- lysts and investors expect less and get more in earnings in reality than had been expected. That is not to say that all companies, at all times , will manage earnings expectations downward. By communicating press releases, meeting with analysts, and giving TV interviews, a firm can engage in Public Expectations Manage- ment (PEM) .Of course, such manipulations, if that is the correct phrase here, are not af fected by the accountant. Still a final manipulation of earnings may come from fraudulent accounting practices.

Channel Stuf fing – Companies sell lar ge amounts of goods to distributors in order to book lar ge profits. Under SEC accounting, it is permissible to book sales for shipped product, less a reasonable allowance for returns. However ,channel stuffers may not be able to make reason- able estimates and would therefore be required to defer rev- enue recognition until return estimates may be projected. This may result in deferring revenue for months. Stuffing occurs when vendors ship merchandise in advance of scheduled shipment dates without buyers’ acquiescence. Bill and Hold – Revenue is booked even though the prod- uct may not have been shipped and payment may not actu- ally be due for a long period. For example, Sunbeam sold 1.The following section was derived from a report in the New Y ork T imes on December 4, 1999, p. C4.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 102 102\n",

            "charcoal grills in the winter , although they were not to be shipped until springtime; after a change in management , books were restated to eliminate the relevant revenue and profit. This arrangement would be allowed, under SEC accounting, provided the buyer requested it; the buyer must also have a good business reason for the request. Further , the goods must be either already assem- bled or otherwise ready for shipment before revenue is rec- ognized. Internet Sales – If an internet site is acting as agent for , as an example, an airline ticket sale, it may only book the revenue it earns. This revenue may be only a commission rather than the full value of the ticket. If it acts as princi- pal,it may book the lar ger amount as revenue and another amount as expense (the portion which it must return to the airline), showing the net result – which would, in ef fect, be the commission. Internet companies whose stock prices are sensitive to “top-line ”growth prefer to recognize sales as principals. Principal transactions are permitted by the SEC provided the company took title to the product before ship- ment and “has the risks andrewards of ownership, such as the risk of loss for collection, delivery , or returns…”.

            "4.5 Business Ethics: Examples of Fraudulent Expense Recognition Business Ethics: Examples of F raudulent Expense Recognition1 Interpretive accounting issues are clearly not limited to the revenue side. Here are some further issues in connection with expenses. The analyst must always be on the alert. Stock options provided to executives are not accounted for as expenses, thereby giving earnings a boost because there is no associated expensing to salary . According to a study by Ms. Pat McConnell of Bear Stearns, in 1999 net income of the S & P would have been 6% lower had employee stock options been reflected as an expense. Options will be exercised at below the market’ s stock prices resulting in an associated cost to the firm. In 1998 and 1997 the reductions would have been 4% and 3% respectively . The F ASB requires that companies include in their foot- notes the ef fect of options granted after 12/15/94. The full effect of this was first felt in 1999 as many companies’ plans allow options to vest in five years or less. If compa- 1.The following was derived from a report in the New Y ork T imes on August 29, 2000, p. C1.105 Kenneth S.Bigel 105\n",

            "nies choose not to disclose options as a compensation expense (and the F ASB does not require this), the disclo- sure must be made as a footnote reflecting the adjusted net income and EPS had the cost of options been charged. Obviously , most companies chose the latter . Ms. McConnell found only Boeing and W inn-Dixie, i.e., just two of the 500 S & P companies, that chose to report options as an expense. Earnings at 21 companies fell by more than half, if options were expensed; this list includes McDermott International, Y ahoo, Autodesk, and Polaroid. Twelve of these companies would have reported a loss, including Micron T echnology . She further cites the fol- lowing declines in earnings due to options: Health Care Services companies-38% Computer Networking companies-24% Commercial and Consumer services-21% Communication Equipment makers-19% Overall, the S & P 500growth rate in earnings would decrease from 1 1% to 9% over the last three years – if options were expensed.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 106\n",

Keep in mind that the purpose of releasing Financial Statements is to enable effective credit and investment decisions, i.e., decisions regarding the future prospects of a business entity . Potential and current lenders wish to assess the creditabil- ityof the firm and shareholders wish to assess thereturn stheir investments will earn. W ill the borrowing corporation be able to make timely interest payments on its debt? W ill shareholders receive suf ficient dividends and growth in their capital investments, i.e., increases in share prices, to justify owning a portion of this corporation after considering the risk sinvolved? A goodpredictor of stock price performance may be book value – assets less liabilities, and earnings. A recent study1 has found that the usefulness of these predictor vari- ables has become attenuated in recent years, more particu- larly since the crisis of 2000-2001. A more useful predictor is cash flow . Cash flows are easier to predict than earnings and book values and have greater impact on price than the others. Yet, regulators and the accounting profession continue pro- ducing rulings that make reading statements more com- 1.SeeThe End of Accounting , by Baruch Lev and Feng Gu (W iley, 2016)113 Kenneth S.Bigel 113\n",

            "plex andtherefore opaque. Accrual accounting, despite its flagrant flaws, has become a faith ,rather than a sci- ence,that suf ficiently describes a certain reality . Does one really need to pore through two hundred pages of arcane financial statement information in order to make an invest- ment decision? Isn’ t the purpose of a statement to simplify and clarify the financial condition and productivity of the corporation and its management? Much has changed in recent decades. W e now live in a much more technological world. Communications are faster . Investment analysis and its implementation are speedier . When we look at financial statements, little, if anything, has changed for the last one hundred years. State- ments look the same; the accounts are the same. Double- entry bookkeeping has not advanced since it was developed inItaly by Luca Pacioli in 1494! Intangibles, including brand names, patents, customer lists, R&D-in- process, training, and information systems, are not carried on the balance sheet, but usually expensed only as incurred. More and more, investment decisions are made using data outside of the accounting sphere. Clearly , accounting reporting methods need updating2 . 2.There were two more crises; the Banking Crisis of 2007-2008, and the COVID-19 outbreak (2020) which led to a market crash, which was NOT due to any financial causes.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 114\n",

            "5.3 Financial Ratios Ratio analysis is fundamental to finance, and ratios are regularly used in this discipline. Ratios are basic tools of analysis. It is very important, therefore, that you master the following. It is important to understand that ratios do not pr ovide answers, but instead raise questions , which t he analyst must then resolve. Questions raised must be investi- gated. Analyst speculations should be based on knowledge of financial statements, the macroeconomic and industry backgrounds in which the company operates, management profiles, and company history .Theratios themselves are derived from accounting data, which are subject to inter- pretive issues. A ratio consists of two numbers, which are compared to one another . “2:1” (two-to-one )or “1:3” are ratios. Infact, anysimple number is a ratio because it can always be compared to one! Fractional numbers also pertain. W e may also think of ratios as consisting of a numerator (on the top) and a denominator (on the bottom) , e.g., 2/1 and 1/3 above. No (financial) ratio means anything by itself – it must be compared to some other datum in order to derive infer- ences. The means by which the comparison may be made are: Longitudinal (Vertical) :This would involve comparing a117 Kenneth S.Bigel 117\n",
            "\n",
            "ratio for a company at two dif ferent points in time. For instance, we may say that IBM ’s profit mar gin last year was 10% versus this year ’s 20%. What are the rele- vant trends?Longitudinal analysis data can be ef fectively diagrammed. Cross-Sectional (Horizontal) : here we would compare two companies on the basis of a selected ratio at the same point in time. This might lead us to conclude, for instance, that one company is more profitable than another at pre- sent. At times, the construction of a financial ratio may involve comparing a Balance Sheet datum with an Income State- ment number . This presents a problem in that the former statement is a static, or “as-of” based statement, whereas the latter is a flow ,or moving picture. In order to compare apples to apples, i.e.,when comparing an Income State- ment with a Balance Sheet number ,the analyst may choose touse an average number for the Bal- ance Sheet datum in order to make the Balance Sheet num- ber appear more like a “flow .”The average may be calculated in various ways, e.g., by averaging two con- secutive year -end data, using quarterlies, or , if available, monthlies. Averaging may be especially warranted in cases where balance sheet data fluctuate widely due to seasonality or other factors. For example, a snow-mobile manufacturer may have much inventory in September and far less inven- tory in March. In such a case, it may be advised for the analyst to average the inventory number over , say , four quarters. In the pages to follow , we will learn how this averaging is actually done by the analyst – and under what circumstances.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 118\n",
            "\n",
            "Below are some important financial ratios, listed by cat- egory . When would you utilize certain ratios? How may your choice of ratio vary from sector to sector (or industry to industry)? In many , if not most, instances there is no universal – minimum, maximum or average – “ideal” ratio that relates to all situations. The ideal ratio, if there is such a thing, is a function of numerous variables, including the nature of the industry , the company , the management risk profile, and perhaps the shareholders ’risk profiles and goals as well. As we go through the discussion regarding Ratio Analysis, some of you may wish to calculate the generic ratios pro- vided using an example. At the end of Chapter Seven, the reader will find a page entitled “Simple Ratio Analysis Exercise.” That page contains a Balance Sheet and Income Statement for a fictitious company; a ratios worksheet fol- lows on the subsequent page, with the solutions following that page. Y ou may work through the ratios there. Keep in mind that the actual ratios’ arithmetic calculations are secondary to the primary and underlying understanding of what the actual ratios are in the abstract, and what they mean. Once you understand the ratios themselves, e.g., what it means when we say that “average collections are 32 days,” or that the TIE Ratio should exceed one, the calcu- lations become a matter of a simple arithmetic exercise, a mere changing of the inputted numbers to fixed formulae. That said, you will find a comprehensive exercise, includ- ing a Balance Sheet and Income Statement, requiring the calculation of all our Financial Ratios below – in Section #7.5.

            "5.5 Liquidity and Liquidity Ratios Note: Toward the end of chapter 5, the student will find a “Ratio Analysis Exercise.” As we go through and explain each of the twenty financial ratios below , the student will, one-by- one, calculate the ratios for the example given in the exer- cise. Y ou will find that the example is constituted by a fictitious company’ s Balance Sheet and Income Statement. We are going to list 20 ratios – covering six categories –in this section. After this discussion, an exercise in calculat- ing all the ratios is presented so that you may apply what you learned . The first category is liquidity ratios. The idea of liquidity has to do with the ease and speed with which an asset may be converted into cash – without compromising its “true” worth or “intrinsic value.” It must satisfy both conditions in order to be considered liquid. For instance, it is possible to sell virtually anything at a“fire–sale price, ”if one needs the cash. The question is whether an item worth, say $100, will fetch $100 – or less. If less, we may say that the item is not liquid, as the seller123 Kenneth S.Bigel 123\n",
            "\n",
            "did not obtain its true worth, even though s/he was able to obtain some cash for it. An example of a liquid asset would be IBM stock. Let’ s say it is trading for $ 190. Should one wish to sell 1 00 shares of the stock, s/he would obtain approximately $19,000 for it. However , if I wanted to sell my tie, for which I paid $50, it may be dif ficult for me to get that amount. Whether you wish to consider the asset’ s“value ”a matter of its original cost or its “current value,” is a matter ofanalytic choice and context . The notion of liquidity is closely tied to another notion: “marketability .” This has to do with the availability of a market in which purchases and sales may be readily trans- acted. For instance, the stock market provides IBM com- mon shares with a great deal of marketability . Should I however wish to sell my tie, I would not know where to go to find a “used- tiemarket.” Real estate markets are domi- nated by brokers who advertise frequently , and I may easily sell my car to a used car dealer . In the case of your typical corporation, it will not own other companies’ stock. It will instead produce goods and services for sale and profit. Thus, it will regularly carry inventory and accounts receivable, which are reported as “current assets.” The net current assets (current assets less current liabilities), being short-term, are presumably liquid. If the assets are liquid, the firm will be able to quickly con- vert the assets into cash, which will be used to honor its current liabilities due. If not liquid, the firm will have dif- ficulty paying its current liabilities; it will be said to have a “liquidity problem.” Now that we know what is meant by liquidity and weIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 124\n",
            "\n",
            "understand that the liquidity notion applies to “net current assets,” let’ s quantify the notion by detailing some relevant ratios that put numbers to the idea. The greater the mea- surable liquidity the less the riskthat the firm will not have sufficient funds to defray its short-term payment require- ments. Curr ent Ratio = Curr ent Asset sDivided by Curr ent Liabilities = CA ÷ CL The current ratio gauges the extent to which a corporation has the liquidity with which it may honor its short-term obligations or liabilities. Does it have the cash to pay its suppliers when accounts payable are due? Are inventories and accounts receivable sufficient (and liquid) to cover its current liabilities? W e will assume, for now that the inven- tory and accounts receivable are completely liquid. It stands to reason that a watermark level for this ratio should be 1:1 or 1x (“one times”) ; one would not want to see this ratio go below that figure as it would imply that the company does not have sufficient current assets and , hence, the liquidity to meet its current obligations. Many analysts agree that 1.5x or 2x are reasonable figures, but we should beleery of such arbitrary minima. Companies that are very ef ficient in the manner in which they manage their current assets may have current ratios close to 1. In general, ratios will vary from industry to industry . Note that this ratio is af fected by the choice of inventory costing method (e.g., FIFO vs. LIFO) because inventory is a con- stituent of current assets .125 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",
            "Note: Working Capital = Current Assets less Current Lia- bilities. If the current ratio is less than one, the working capital will be negative. (See Ratio Exercise.) Quick Ratio (“Acid T est”) = (CA – Inv entory)÷CL Some analysts take a more conservative approach in the assessment of liquidity coverage by assuming that inven- tory is worthless (even though it may , in fact, not be – or not be entirely) and hence that current liabilities will be covered by all current assets except inventory .

            "The current and quick ratios may be thought of as “cover- age” ratios in that they indicate the extent to which liquid assets are adequate to “cover ,” or pay of f, current liabil- ities, especially accounts payable and notes payable (i.e., short-term loans). Average Collection Period ( ACP ) =Days sales out- standing (DSO) = (A/R ÷Credit Sales) (360) “A/R” stands for Accounts Receivable. This ratio tells the analyst approximately how long it takes the firm to collect its receivables; the ratio is expressed in days. The shorter the collection period, the more liquid the firm’ s accounts receivable. Note that we use credit sales because only credit (and not cash) sales become accounts receivable. This ACP figure may then be compared to the firm’ s typical credit terms. If, for ar gument’ s sake, the ACP exceeds the firm’ s credit terms, which may be 30 days, the analyst may first assess whether the firm is having collection problems. Alterna- tively , the analyst may investigate whether the firm is act- ing aggressively in its marketing, and choosing to live with the consequences of some late payments as a result. Perhaps the firm expects that the incremental profits will exceed any losses in its collections. This ratio is our first case, so far , of “apples and oranges” in that, here, we note that both income statement and bal- ance sheet number s appear within the same ratio. This inconsistency needs to be fixed ; we ought not to com- bine one datum from the Balance Sheet , which is asta- ticfigure , with an other from the Income Statement , which is aflow kind of number ,within one ratio . The two areinconsistent with each other .127 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",
            "In such cases as this, what the analyst may choose to do is “average” the balance sheet number . One way of doing this would be by taking this year ’s and last year ’s year - end numbers and averaging them(i.e., add the two numbers up and divide by two). W e could also use quarterlies or , if available, monthlies. In businesses where receivables fluc- tuate over the course of the year and may thus be either rel- atively high or low at certain times of year or during certain seasons, it may be better to average the quarterly numbers, if possible. This technique would then capture a better sense of move- ment over the course of the seasonal business cycle and would thus provide a better comparison with the income statement number , which , again, flow over the course of theentire year .If the balance sheet number does not fluc- tuate – much, or at all – over time, there may be no need for averaging. This choice is at the discretion of the ana- lyst. Compare Companies “A” and “B” in terms of their accounts receivable or inventory levels , as it were, over the course of four quarters. Is anything accom- plished by averaging theBalance Sheet numbers for Com- pany A? You will alsonote that (usually) Accounts Receivable willdisplay a smaller number than Sales . Normally , we would expect that accounts receivable are collected more or less monthly ;indeed, ifsales terms are 30 days, weIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 128\n",

            "should get about 12 collections per year .This is illustrated on the next page. We shall also assume a 360-day year ,consisting of twelve 30-day rolling months ,because most often collections are demanded within 30 days . Some analysts will use a 365-day year on the rationale that Credit Sales accumu- lateover a365-day calendar year .It’s your choice, Ms/r. Analyst! Final note: If you are analyzing data for just one quar- ter,you should use 90, rather than 360, as the multiplier for theACP .For two or three quarters, you will use 180 and 270respectively . Inventory T urnover = COGS ÷Inventory This ratio tells us how often the inventory “turns over ,” that is to say , how often the inventory – in its entirety – is replaced. Would you buy fresh tomatoes from a company whose inventory turnover is 10x a year (or every 36 days)? Note that this ratio is af fected by the choice of inventory costing method. This ratio has some issues with mixing Balance Sheet and Income Statement numbers, which was discussed the prior section concerning ACP .129 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

            "5.6 The Income Statement v ersus the Balance Sheet It is important to understand how related Balance Sheet and Income Statement numbers may compare with one another , especially when used in a particular ratio. For instance, in the A verage Collection Period, we compare MONTHL Y credit sales (from the Income Statement) to MONTHL Y accounts receivable (from the Balance Sheet). Which number is bigger? T ake note that the quarterly data for the Credit Sales are cumulative as reported by the accountant. W e are also assuming that the receivables are collected in full at each month’ s end.

W e are assuming that credit terms are 30 days and that all receivables are col- lected on time. Which number is greater – the credit sales or the accounts receivable? Clearly , after February , Credit Sales, which are cumulative, will exceed accounts receivable. A similar analysis may beapplied to the inventory turnover ratio.131 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

            "5.7 Accounts Receivable Aging Schedule An aging schedule is an internal, managerial, and confi- dential document, which shows, account by account, how much money is due the seller from the time of sale, and whether a customer account is “current” or is “pa st due.” It is a necessary management tool. The schedule would provide the external analyst with much more than s/he may otherwise know by alternatively cal- culating Days Sales Outstanding. It is much more detailed. Unfortunately , the schedule is an internal management doc- ument and unavailable to outsiders. The customer accounts are listed row by row , either by name or some some other identifier . Since most credit sales require payment within 30 days, the first column shows how much money is due where the sale occurred less than 30 in the past. As you read to the right, you will see uncol- lected credit sales figures that are more than 30, 60, and 90 days old, and the respective amounts due. Thus, the sched- ule might look somewhat like t hefollowing. In examining the schedule, what might you tentatively conclude about each of the five listed accounts?Introduction toFinancial Analysis 132 132\n",
            "\n",
            "By examining this schedule, the analyst may uncover some interesting findings. For instance: 1.ACP/ DSO may be higher than the company’ s sales terms due, possibly , to one very lar ge account skewing the average. It may also be greater due to the company’ s decision to enter a new geographical or product market, knowing in advance that such entry will slow down its col- lections, but expecting that the added profits will make the expansion worthwhile. 2.The analyst may see how many accounts are current and how many should be written of f– analytically – by the analyst. (Remember: this is not accounting, so a real “write-of f”would be recorded by the accountant .) 3.This schedule does not tell the reader anything about the profitability of the accounts (butnei- ther does theACP ). It could very well be, for instance, that account #1, which apparently pays well,is also purchasing very low mar gin prod- ucts. While not necessarily of great importance to the Accounts R eceivable manager , the mar- keting manager may be very interested in prof- itability . 4.Overall, it appears that the company133 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

            "5.8 Solv ency Ratios Solvency has to do with the firm’ s ongoing ability to gener- atesufficient liquidity from Operating Earnings (EBIT) in order to meet its continuing debt-service obligations , par- ticularly interest payments, timely and fully .The two most common solvency ratios have to do with “leverage,” or the extent to which the firm employs debt as a source of capital as opposed to using equity . Some debt is desirable as it allows the firm’ s owners or shareholders to exploit “other people’ s money” ( OPM ) in order to earn greater profits on a per share basis than they would in the absence of debt , i.e., OPM . Too much debt, however , may be a bad thing as it increases the firm’ s riski- ness by adding on an increasing requirement to payinterest on the debt. “TIE” Ratio = Times Inter est Earned ( orInter est Cov- erage) = EBIT ÷Inter est Expense EBIT stands for “Earnings before Interest and T axes.” Over time, a company’ s operating earnings (EBIT) may fluctuate, the extent of whi ch fluctuation depends on the company’ s business and its industry . For example, a lawn- mower (or snowmobile) manufacturer will have high sales and inventory at certain times of year and low at other times; we refer to this phenomenon as “seasonality .” The company’ s interest expnses is relatively flat over time because the company does not often borrow and its interest expenses are fixed.135 Kenneth S.Bigel 135\n",
            "\n",
            "In any case, this ratio looks at the extent to which EBIT exceeds the interest expense on its debt over time. Is this margin (or buf fer) a “safe” amount? (Some analysts will add back depreciation and amortization to EBIT to arrive at “EBITDA” – operating cash flow – on the rationale that interest is paid with cash.) In the diagram below , you will find inserted three possible EBIT curves for a fictitious firm; each possibility is rep- resented by a dif ferent colored curve.. The “wavier” the EBIT line, the more volatile its operating earnings are/will beover the course of some period s or years . The question is: overall, which curve represents the most secure TIE ratio and why? T he implications profoundly relate to the firm’ s Solvency! EBIT may look like a kind of horizontal squiggle, thesquigglyness of which depends on the volatility of the firm’ s operating earnings. The question then is whether interest expense (the straight horizontal line), which should be relatively flat over time, is above, below , or somewhere in the middle of the squiggle. Interest expense would appear as a horizontal line, since it is relatively flat over time because the company’ s level of indebtedness changes little, if at all, over time. Again, the company’ s EBIT should be suf ficiently above the interest expense line ,the extent of which dif ferentialIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 136\n",
            "\n",
            "depends on the nature of the company’ s business and the manner in which the company is managed. A contingency may arise that if EBIT is low relative to (or worse ,below) the interest expense, will the firm have the capacity to make the required and timely (cash) payment of inter- est?Persistent insolvency may lead to bankruptcy . Debt ÷ NW By “NW ,” we mean “net worth,” or (total) “equity” (remember the basic accounting equation: A – L = NW). Analysts will disagree as to what is meant by “debt.” Some will concern themselves only with long-term liabil- ities; others will include current liabilities among “Debt.” In most instances, and for our present use, we will refer to “total liabilities” as debt, a reasonable default assumption since Debt + NW = 100% of assets , thus excluding nothing on the Balance Sheet . While one cannot say what the ideal “ debt-to-net-worth ratio” ought to be, it is safe to say that as the ratio increases, thecompany’ s ongoing ability to service its debt (i.e., to pay interest in particular) is reduced, and the likelihood of bankruptcy increases. In general, the ratio will change from industry to industry . Some industries are character- ized by greater indebtedness, or “leverage” than others. Wewill have more to say about this later . This ratio may be less than or greater than one. In the Balance Sheet to the right, the Debt-to-Net W orth Ratio is 500:500 or 1:1, “one to one.” The T otal Assets are $1,000.137 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",
            "Debt ÷TA The default option for defining “debt” is again “total liabil- ities.” Again, remember that T otal Assets = Debt + Equity (TA = D + Eq). In this case, as the ratio increases, the com- pany’ s solvency becomes increasingly at risk. This ratio should notbe thought of as “coverage” ratios, in the same sense that the current and quick ratios are (or for that matter as the TIEratio is). In the latter cases, we view the adequacy (or inadequacy) of current assets as suf ficient – or not – to pay for the company’ s current liabilities. The firm needs liquid current assets to pay of f its current liabil- ities. Such is not the correct manner ,in which to interpret the debt ratios. The company does not need itsequity to “pay off” its debts! It i s incorrect to say that the net worth, or equity , of the company is “adequate ”in this sense . The only time that that equity will be used to pay of f debt is in theworst case of bankruptcy and (net) asset liquidation! In most cases, you will be analyzing an ongoing enterprise, not a bankrupt one. Instead ,these two debt ratios (D/NW and D/T A)aresim- plymeasures of the magnitude of a company’ s indebted- ness and, as such, are useful in comparison to other compan ies in its industry ,and to itself over time. Does XYZ Corporation have a lot of debt in comparison (or in propor- tionto) to its industry peers? Is its indebtedness increasing? A more useful solvency coverage ratio, if you are looking for on ethat most directly addresses solvency , is the “T imes Interest Earned” ratio, above .The “ TIE” ratio provides aIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 138\n",

            "Leveragegauge of the company’ s ability to pay ( i.e., to “cover”) the interest payable (or paid) on its debt. The D/T A ratio above would be 500/1,000 or 50%. While the D/NW is more popular , the D/T A ratio gives the analyst animaginary range of 0-100% of debt in comparison to total assets. The D/NW ratio gives no such reasonable range. In any case, one ratio can be easily inferred from the other . Total Assets ÷Equity Another solvency ratio is D / T A. This ratio will be pre- sented and discussed when we get to the “DuPont Model” somewhat later (see Sections 6.3 and 6.4). In summary , the more debt a company has relative to either its Equity or its T otal Assets, the more leverage it is said to have, by definition. In Physics, a “lever” allows one to get more output with the same input as compared to not using the lever . “If at First…. ” I can accept failur e; everyone fails at something.

Each of the foregoing data (without the word “mar gin”)may be divided by “T otal Sales” and used cross-sectionally or lon- gitudinally . “Mar gin” means percentage. For example, gross profit mar gin = gross profits ÷ sales. In discussing liquidity ratios, we agreed that in order tomanage liquidity risk the current ratio should be at least one.We can also agree thattoo high a current ratio may be unhealthy . This is because current assets, especially cash, produce no return . Having inventory sitting around does no good. A question to ask is: Why has the firm accumu- lated cash and other current assets rather than investing in more productive, fixed assets? There must be a balance between liquidity on the one hand, and return (see below) on the other .Too much of anything may not be good. Even though the firm may have high profitability , it does not mean that its cash flow position is strong. One must also examine the solvency ratios, especially the TIEratio.143 Kenneth S.Bigel 143\n",

            "The company may have onerous obligations due to matur- ing debt and the need for replacement of long-term assets. A growing company may need a great deal of liquidity , in order to support growing sales, which growth would be reflected in growing inventory and accounts receiv- able. The analyst should also check the firm’ sLiquidity . Return Measur es: We will discuss two important return measures. These ratios give the analyst another look at prof- itability . ROA = Return on Assets = EBIT ÷TA How well is a firm employing its assets? Return on Assets attempts to gauge this. While many will use net income in the numer ator, EBIT is preferable in the sense that operat- ing profits reflect what the assets produce, whereas net income is af fected by the firm’ s capital structure ,i.e., interest expense andparticularly taxes, and othe r possible items not directly associated with the firm’ s actual busi- ness or “operations.” ROA may be a good tool to judge management’ s operat- ing performance and its “asset utilization ,”or how effi- ciently itexploits the firm’ s assets. Why may two, otherwise identical companies, have dif ferent ROAs? Does one company manage better? Does it motivate its employees better? Are they better trained? Do they work harder or longer hours? Does it employ better technology? ROE = Return on Equity = NI ÷EquityIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 144\n",
            "\n",
            "Common shareholders are most interested in ROE because that is what they get for their equity investment. They understand that for each dollar of equity invested, they will have a claim on the company’ s net income, i.e., its divi- dends and (additions to) retained earnings. What kind of return is the firm able to produce on its equity? Equity is the result of,notjust the company’ s past operating performance (EBIT) andits associated accumu- lation of retained earnings, but management’ scapital struc- turedecision s(i.e., the debt/equity ratio) when it had to raise capital in the past. T he more debt there is ,the lessequity ;the more interest expense ,the less net income. EBIT also af fects Net Income! While ROA reflects the firm’ s effectiveness in producing operating profits, or EBIT , the ef fective use of leverage, i.e., debt, can increase the firm’ s ROE above its ROA. This is notguaranteed; borrowing does not en sure in all instances that ROE > ROA. In addition ,“leverage ,”i.e., the use of debt ( OPM ),increases the firm’ s financial , or solvency ,risk. We shall get a glimpse of this when we – soon – look into the DuPont model on the very next page. ROA and Leverage (i.e., the extent to which a firm utilizes debt) are inter -related. Stay tuned. ROE may be a better tool (t han ROA) for assessing a firm’ s(equity) investment merits, because shareholders are most interested in net income as that will either be distrib- utedto them as dividends and/or added to retained earn- ings, which are “owned” by shareholders.

In other words, how much Sales does a company produce from its fixed or total assets? If two identical firms dif fer in only this respect, what might the analyst conclude? Does one firm maximize price and revenues? Does one firm manage production and exploit its asse ts more ef fi- ciently ,more productively ?What do turnover ratios say about pricing, asset utilization ,and management perfor- mance? An analyst may prefer using total assets rather than just fixed assets, in this analysis, if the company being ana- lyzed is a service company with fewer fixed assets to speak ofin comparison with a heavy manufacturing firm .An ana- lyst may use Asset T urnover rather than Return Ratios in the case where EBIT = 0.

First, looking top-down, you are interested in ROE. The model shows us the ef fect of leverage on ROE, given the prior level of ROA. Then, it ascribes operating performance, as defined by ROA, as being attributable to Profit Mar gin and T otal Asset Turnover . This enables executives to locate areas of weak- ness within the firm and address them. Let’s illustrate how Leverage benefits an unnamed corpo- ration, given its ROA.

Alternatively , let’ s say the company has no leverage, but the same in T otal Assets. In other words, the assets are financed in full by equity only . ROA = 100 / 1,000 = 0.10 Leverage = 1,000 / 1,000 = 1.0 ROE = (0.10) (1.0) = 0.10 Without anyLeverage at all , ROE = ROA. Of course, Leverage is not something that the company should employ indiscr imina tely. Too much debt will raise interest expense topossibly unsustainable levels and thus could have a weakening ef fect on the TIE ratio, leading eventually to insolvency and bankruptcy –in the worst case. The DuPont Model does not address this risk. The Dupont Model is useful for assessment of past perfor- mance. It is a poor planning tool. Looking at this exam- ple, one may be encouraged to employ more and more risk. Of course, as just noted, too much debt is not necessarily a good thing: it increases the risk of becoming insolvent – causing the TIE Ratio to be below one.151 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

A Value Stock may be thought of as such because its price – relative to itsearnings – represents a “good buy” for the money , i.e., cheaper . The analyst must be cognizant of the possibility that a low PE may also mean that its future earnings prospects are generally deemed unfavor- able. In contrast, Growth Stocks will reflect (very) high PEs on the basis of generally optimistic views of future earnings growth. Does this mean that earnings willnecessarily catch up with price? Let’s say that a company’ s PE = $50/$1 = 50 times earnings. That is a very157 Kenneth S.Bigel 157\n",

            "Growth Stockhigh ratio. If the market anticipates next year’s earnings to double, the stock may be said to be trading at just $50/$2 = 25times next year ’s earnings , a more rea- sonable ratio. High PEs are the ef fect of thehigh expec- tations the market has for future growth in a com- pany’ searnings. As a company’ s earnings grow in the future, the multiple that one paid for his shares goes down, making the purchase, with the benefit of hindsight, a good choice. For example, if a company earns $1 per share and sells for $50, its PE will equal 50x earnings, quite high, quite “expensive” for what you get. If ,however ,the earnings next year do indeed grow to say , $5 per share, the buyer at last year ’s price w hopurchased the stock for a meager $50, oronly 10x next year ’s earnings , got a good deal .There- fore, companies with h igh growth expectations will mani- fest higher PE ratios than the boring companies with low growth prospects. A stock analyst might have said that the PE ratio is now 50x, but only 10x next year ’sexpected earn- ings – if s/he so prophesied. At the time this is being written, average PE ratios for the S& P 500 Index of (publicly-traded) stocks are approxi- mately “20 times earnings.” Why would someone pay so much for each dollar of earnings? In contrast, privately- owned stocks, i.e., those not traded on the public-markets, will have much lower PE ratios.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 158\n",
            "\n",
            "Liquidity PremiumOne explanation has to do with the Liq- uidity Pr emium associated with publicly traded stocks. “Liquidity” has to do with the ease and speed with which a seller can convert an asset, in this case stock, into cash while obtaining a sales price that represents that asset’ s true value, i.e., without reduction in price from its true, or “intrinsic” value. It is generally very easy to buy and sell a stock. All one needs to do is place an order with a stock- broker (and pay for it within the required three-day settle- ment period for stock). There is an added or premium value in this liquidity . That is why “Private Equity” investments can be so profitable. A private company will sell at a much lower PE ratio due to the lack of liquidity . If the company is later sold in an IPO (“initial public of fering” – the point at which time a stock is sold to the public for the first time), there will be much profit to go around! The true cost of buying a privately owned company , i.e., one whose stock or equity is not traded on the public stock exchanges, is not embedded in the price one pays for buying such private corporations. In order to purchase a privately owned company , one has to search for an appro- priate one, one that is also available to purchase. This involved time and time is money . The potential buyer is spending time engaged in the search rather than pursuing other profitable opportunities. This is not an issue where publicly traded stock is concerned. These companies are readily available for rapid purchase and sale. Moreover , in order to buy a private company , one must employ the services of an attorney to negotiate and close159 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",
            "Cash-on- cash Returnthe deal. Bankers must be involved because private stock is usually purchased with lar ge (and often borrowed) sums as opposed to the purchase of a minimum number of shares of stock in a publicly traded stock corporation with few funds. These other costs must be reflected as opportunity costs and thus, under the “Law of One Price” ought to be reflected in the prices of publicly traded stock. Law of One Price requires that similar assets ought to be priced simi- larly. There are certain demerits to the PE Ratio. For instance, Earnings aresubject to accrual account- ingmanipulation s. Moreover , companies with very low ornegative earnings yield ameaningless PE ratio. A com- pany with low earnings may command a ridiculously high PE. A company with negative earnings will not yield a PE at all – it is not computable! Dividend Y ield = D per shar e÷Ppershare One may view this as the Cash-on-cash Return that a stock may provide. If I pay $10 for YawrCo.stock and it pays anannual dividend of $1, my “cash- on-cash return ”or dividend yield is 10%. Some industries will reflect higher divi- dend yields than others . Dividends are usually paid from current net income, but if there are losses ,dividends would have to be paid from retained earnings. T ypi- cally , mature, rather than growth compa- nies,pay high dividends. This yield ignores price changes.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 160\n",
            "\n",
            "Total Return Signal SignalingIt is eminently noteworthy that the divi- dend yield excludes any capital growth, which is integral to YawrCo. stock’ s Total Return . In other words, the T otal Return equals the dividend yield plus the capital gain (or loss) expressed in per- centage terms. If you purchased thisstock for $10 and sold it at $15, your capital gain would be 50%. The T otal Return is: 10% + 50% = 60%. It is often considered a positive Signal that a company maintains its dividend in the face of losses. This Signal- ingindicates manage- ment’ s optimism about future earnings prospects. The dividend itself thus boils down to a “human decision” by the firm’ s board of directors, rather than a measure of business performance per se. If the board feels that the future is good, it may choose to pay dividends even if the company is presently losing money . Dividend Payout Ratio = PR = D Total ÷ NI = DPS ÷ EPS This ratio indicates the percentage of net income, which is paid out to common shareholders as div- idends. If a firm earns $1,000,000 and pays $100,000 in dividends, its payout ratio is 10%. If there is preferred stock, the preferred dividends161 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

            "would first have to be deducted from the net income. The PR formula would be adjusted: PR = (Common Stock Dividends) ÷ (Net Income – Pre- ferred Stock Dividends). Retention Rate = RR = 1 – PR = (NI – D Total ) ÷ NI = ARE ÷ NI This ratio indicates how much of the company’ s earnings are retained internally for future growth and, as such, together with the firm’ s ROE impact the firm’ s growth potential. On the next page, we discuss the relationship between earnings retention and firm’ s growth. (This will be explicated further below in the “EFN Model.”) Naturally , PR + RR = 1.0 = 100%.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 162\n",

In order to grow its sales, and hope- fully its profits thereby , the firm must retain some of its earnings and invest them in productive assets that can be exploited to increase sales in the future. Let’sexamine the following company: If the company’ s ROE is assumed to be constant, i.e., one of those ceteris paribus assumptions, then the numbers next year will be: So, as we see, earnings retention is helpful for growth.

            "7.4 The P/BV (Price-to-Book V alue ) and P/E (Price-Earnings) Ratios The price of a stock alone does not tell you anything about its value. T ake two stocks, one of which is trading at $20 and has 1,000,000 shares outstanding, while the other trades at $10 and has 2,000,000 shares outstanding. Which one has greater value? They are both the same! Instead, we will look at relative value, i.e., price relative to either of two measures: Book V alue (BV) per share and Earnings per share (EPS). Book V alue per share is mea- sured by the accountant’ s assessment of the company’ s equity (excluding preferred stock, if any) divided by the company’ s number of (common) equity shares outstanding (NOSO). W e already know how to calculate EPS. Let’s take the example of two companies that have the same share price, the same number of shares outstanding, but dif ferent book values per share (i.e., assets minus liabil- ities divided by the number of shares outstanding). Which stock is a better “value”? Which is a better investment? At the same price, it seems that LCM is a better buy .LCM provides greater BV for each dollar of share price. Clearly , while the market price alone does not necessarily tell you165 Kenneth S.Bigel 165\n",
            "\n",
            "whether the stock is a “good buy” or not (both stocks here have the same price), there is alsosome question as to whether Book Value is a reasonable measure. The balance sheet perspective (i.e., “account- ingbook value,” or the company’ s net assets) depicted above is fraught with the many interpre- tiveaccrual accounting problems enumerated ear- lier(specifically , we enumerated four issues). There islikely more historical bias embedded in book value than in earnings. On the other hand, Price-to-Book (P/BV) tends to be amore stable measure than the PE ratio. Further , P/ BVignores how well management utilizes the assets in producing earnings for shareholders. Earnings certainly matter! Earnings are what most shareholders focus on.

            "\n",
            "◦Earnings production Another way of making th eassessment of whether the stock price is “fair” or not, would be by looking at the stock’ sP/E ratio, i.e., Price (per share) ÷ Earnings (per share). How much does the prospective (or current) share- holder pay fora share of the stock in order for him to “earn” so much in terms of EPS? Remember that the shareholder is most interested in earnings per share because that is the source of his dividends and retained earnings, a portion of which he owns. In contrast to the first approach, this approach is income statement oriented. You should be able to calculate EPS and PE independently . EPS are $ 1 and $0.10 per share for LCM and TC respec- tively . Clearly , however , LCM is “cheaper ,” with a PE ratio of 10 0xearnings ,whereas TC reflects a ratio of 1,000x its earnings – if you accept PE as a valid valuation/pricing measure. (ThePE ratio spresented in this example aremuch higher than will be typically found in the markets – even in good times. )167 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

The prof- its, in turn will be either distributed to the shareholder as a (cash) dividend – or retained by the corporation and then reinvested in additional assets that should produce even more profits going forward. We have already cited the basic problems in utilizing (legit- imate) accounting data in the course of financial analysis. Was “book value” useful in this example? In recent years, management and its accountants have been very “creative” in the presentation of accounting summaries. Is EPS reli- able accounting-wise? The analyst has to be cognizant of alternative accounting presentations – both legitimate and not. Note regarding EPS calculation : The calculation for EPS presented above (i.e., net income ÷ the number of shares outstanding) is simplistic and should be used only when better data are not available. In fact, the accountant will present both “Basic” and“Diluted ”EPS, the calculation sfor which are quite involved. The student analyst must choose whether to uti- lize the Basic EPS datum in calculating the PE ratio or the Diluted version . The Diluted datum assumes that convertible and other “complex” securities have been converted to stock; this results in a lower EPS number .

Theexternal (securities) analyst, i.e., one who isnotemployed by the subject corporation, but perhaps who works instead for a financial institution thathassome investment or equity interest in the corpora- tion, will not have access to the same valuable informa- tionand data that the internal corporate analyst will have.

For each of the following, indicate from which department the projections may come (e.g., economics, marketing, purchasing, etc.) . Unit Sales First, the internal analyst may receive unit sales projections from the marketing department. The analyst must also be aware of the issue of Cannibal- ization –the detrimental ef fect on other sales of the intro- duction of the new project (see section #8.4). For example, if Microsoft projects sales of two million units of W indows Vista, of which one million would have otherwise gone to W indows XP sales, the analyst would recognize on his spreadsheet only the one-million-unit increment. This is because the decision to introduce a new product came, inasense ,at the expense of the old product’ s sales.

Operating Costs This information may be derived from many dif ferent par- ties, e.g., purchasing, operations, etc. Operating costs may include: •Cost of Goods Sold : This refers to inventory costs as explained earlier . •Selling, general, and administrative costs :These costs refer to non-production expenditures, including salaries and wages, rent, advertising, and travel. •Taxes: Although taxes are not an operating cost per se, we all know what Ben Franklin said about “death and taxes.” Since taxes cannot be avoided, they should be deducted in the analy- sis.

Once the ana- lyst has arrived at the yearly operat- ingnumbers, usually projected cash flow (rather than accounting prof- its), the cost of capital will then be brought in as the “discount rate,” rather than as a dollar figure. This is the rate at which the future cash flows will be “discounted ,” or translated ,to present values, thereby enabling a level playing field, in terms of time. In other words, by discounting, we are able to equate the value of a dollar paid tomorrow with a dollar today .This way , an investment decision may be made based on profitability and possibly other measures.

In general, the prin- ciple of incrementalism pertains. It is only incremental cash flows, i.e., those which are added due to the project’ s implementation, which are relevant to decision-making. If the company brought in $100 and now – with the new project – it brings in $125, the increment is $25. Incremental revenues –and costs –did not exist before the project waseffected. Therefore, sunk costs and the cannibal- izedportions of projections’ data are excluded as will be discussed immediately below .It is the incremental data which drive the decision to invest or not. W e will learn this better by example. By contrast, the accountant reports allhistorical economic events. Later , we will conduct a basic exercise in producing a pro-forma statement , i.e., aprojected, income state- ment. Below are the two types of incrementalism:Introduction toFinancial Analysis 196 196\n",

            "Sunk Costs Cannibal- izationSunk Costs –these are expenditures which have already been outlaid and should not be therefore “double- counted.” For example, suppose a factory has unused , or under -used, equipment, which may be exploited, for a proposed project. The cost of the equipment having already been spent or “sunk,” should not be considered again; the cost is not rele- vant to deciding, for example, whether or notan existing asset should be exploited in a new way . The project merely proposes to exploit unused, or under -uti- lized, assets –or“sunk costs ”–in order to increase sales and profits. Cannibalization – When a new product is introduced, some of the revenue may have been cannibalized from the potential sales of the old product. For example, if the new product is expected to sell 1.5 million units, and the old product hadsold 1.0 million, we are interested only in the 0.5 mm increment. That is what the investment decision depends upon. Hence the phrase “cannibalization.” A change in pricing would complicate this analysis, i.e., how much of the revenue increase is due to volume and how much is due to a price increase?197 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

            "8.7 The T ax Effect of Depreciation Depr eciation is a non-cash expense (and NOT an “expen- diture”) , which serves to recognize the consumption of fixed assets over time , e.g.,plant and equipment, but NOT property . The“consumption ,” or use, of long-term, fixed assets is reflected as a separate operating, depreciation expense. Although depreciation is a non-cash expense, it provides the corporation with cash because it reduces taxable income and hence the tax liability . When depreciation can be “imputed ”to the manufacturing process, its char ges are included in the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS ).For example, if the manufacturer of a $1 mil- lion piece of equipment warrants that the machine will be used up after manufacturing 1 million units, the accoun- tant may impute (i.e., include) $1 per unit of production to COGS. This could confuse the statements reader . Below , we will notassume such “imputation.” Illustration of Depreciation T ax Shield (Ignoring Interest Expense) :203 Kenneth S.Bigel 203\n",

            "Due to depreciation, a non-cash expense, net income will be lower by only $12 rather than the full $20 of depreci- ation expensed; the $8 dif ference represents the tax sav- ings, and hence the “tax shield,” due to the deduction of the depreciation expense. Tax Shield = (D) (T) = ($20) ( 0.40) = $8 The “tax shield” of depreciation, i.e., D (T) , is a very real phenomenon in that it actually reduces the tax burden, which is viewed as a provision of cash, albeit depreciation alone provides no cash. The acquisition of a depreciable asset , e.g., a building or equipment, creates a tax shield or benefit that provides more cash flow than before the acquisition. You may think of “EBITDA” (i.e., earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) as EBIT plus depreci- ation (and amortization ).

            "9.2 F ree Cash Flow Why Cash Flow ? A corporation’ s value is dependent, in large part, on the income and cash flow it produces. Cash flow is dif ferent from income in that “income” is based on “accrual accounting,” which will reflect certain non- cash events such as depreciation, and many other “dis- tortions,” some of which were discussed earlier . One key distortion had to do with “timing” – the accountant may book a sale, for example when “constructively received,” i.e., when legally and economically receivable, but not yet received in actual cash. Under accrual accounting, the accountant records eco- nomic transactions rather than the movement of actual cash received and paid out. (In theory , in the long run such accounting vs. cash dif ferences even out.) Because of these differences, financial analysts, who are more cash-oriented, must make certain adjustments to the accounting data in their own calculations and projections. In a certain sense, cash flow is more important to corporate valuation than income because dividends are paid out to investors in cash. Further , when engaging in corporate planning, a possible capital investment will be judged attractive dependent upon the cash flow it produces in the future because it is cash that, ar guably , fuels growth. What is Free Cash Flow ? Capital investments, i.e., “growth” investments, include expenditures for hard assets, as well as for product development, and much more.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 208 208\n",
            "\n",
            "“Free cash flow” is funds that an investment project or the corporation as a whole generates beyond its own internal and ongoing needs. W e may think of free cash flow as the cash, which is left over from an investment project, after all net operating funds generated by the project are uti- lized for necessary , non-discretionary purposes, including hard assets’ maintenance and replacement, and increases in working capital; this “left-over” amount may be used for other financial purposes – growth or expansion, at the dis- cretion of management. Working capital must often be increased. The project, or corporation, first generates operating cash flows, some of which are needed to replace or maintain assets, to invest in inventory and receivables, and to maintain the firm’ s com- petitive position. So, think of “free” cash flow (FCF) as discr etionary , think of it as “ Discr etionary Cash Flow .”Necessary capital and other non-discretionary expenditures are required in order to maintain the business as is. A leaky roof must be repaired; there is no choice. A worn-out gasket must be replaced. Analogously , you may recall the parallel notion of “dispos- able income” in Macroeconomics. (After deducting taxes, and necessities, such as food and rent, from gross income, the consumer has some funds left over for discretionary purposes, which might include investment, or buying that deluxe Apple W atch s/he has coveted for so long.) Simi- larly, “free cash flow” is the net, operating after -tax cash that the firm may generate from investment in a new build- ing or equipment (i.e., the investment “project”) after con- sidering necessary operating and capital expenditures, including maintenance and replacement, but excluding209 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",
            "expansionary , or growth-oriented, capital expenditures as this would be discretionary . The more FCF the firm generates, the greater the firm’ s ability to invest in new assets, to use the funds to pay down debt or to pay dividends, and still other discretionary pos- sibilities. The Mathematics One formula for use inthis process is presented below .We start with operating earnings, which, in this case, is defined as“EBIT” or , alternatively “EBITDA1 ,”i.e., earn- ings before interest, taxes, and amortization2 . To the finan- cial analyst, the projected income or cash flow statement may look something like the following: Thus the analyst would calculate Free Cash Flow (FCF) to equal: [(EBIT DA)(1 – T) ]+[(Depr eciation )(T)]–[Neces- 1.In some instances, an analyst may choose to use “EBITDA,” i.e., EBIT with depreciation and amortization added back. The use of this figure will depend on the data presentation and analyst choice. 2.As we will learn later in this text, amortization has to do with the reduction in the value of an intangible asset over time; in this sense it is like deprecia- tion.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 210\n",

            "sary Capital Expenditur es]–[Increase in Net W orking Capital ] The elements of the formula The formula consists of four different parts. Let’ s look at each of them. 1.EBITDA (1 – T) 2.Add: Depreciation (T ax Rate) = (D) × (T) 3.Less: Necessary Capital Expenditures3 4.Less: Increases in Net W orking Capital 5.Equals: Free Cash Flow (FCF) Note that “T” (in “1-T” and in “D x T” )stands for the firm’ s tax bracket , or percent , whereas EBITDA is in dol- lars, including the “T” there. While at this stage of the cor- porate planning and investment analysis process, the firm has not yet decided whether it will choose the investment or not and, if so, how it will be financed, and therefore does not know its projected interest payments, it does know its tax bracket, which is based on the firm’ smeeting a speci- fied lower threshold (“bracket”) of earnings. 1.EBITDA : Takenote of the use of EBIT DArather than EBT in the formula .There are several details here, which bear expla- nation; we will take them one at a time. First, account- 3.Note that “Capital Expenditures” here refers only to requir edexpenditures, i.e., maintenance and replacement expenditures, and notdiscr etionary expenditures, which may be used for expansion and growth. By subtracting out necessary (i.e., non-discretionary) CE, we are left with Free CF .211 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",
            "ingEBT would include interest expense – as a deduction from EBIT .“Interest expense” isthe result of aprior capi- talfinancing decision and, as such, should b e independent of this analysis , which focuses on the cash-based, operat- ingearnings a firm or a project produces (EBITDA) ,and not on financial decisions .In our analysis and projections, we should thus exclude interest , which is a discretionary capital structure, solvency-oriented matter for decision . Accordingly , the “EBITDA (1 – T)” adjustment elimi- nates the interaction of interest and its ef fect on tax. To see how this adjustment works, let us compare the results of the formula with the following alternate spreadsheet pre- sentation. Let’ s say that the firm produces $100,000 of EBITDA, has interest expense of $20,000, and pays taxes at a 30% rate. By formula we would project EBITDA (1 – T) = $100,000 (1 – .30) = $70,000 .(For this example, we shall assume, for the moment, that depreciation and amor- tization are zero.) This is the figure we want, which repre- sents earnings after taxes, in the absence of interest. The “1 – T” multiplier shows what is left after paying taxes. This project produces, or is expected to produce, $70,000 in operating cash flow (next year). Inthe following spreadsheet, we would show the same $70,000 result , only by dif ferent presentation (in order to prove outthe formula) – under the alter- nate FCF analysis .We also show , side by side, the accounting income reported , which does not suit the pur- pose of the analysis because it includes interest expense, which is a financial – not an operating – event or cash (out- ) flow .Introduction toFinancial Analysis 212\n",
            "\n",
            "2.TheDepreciation Tax Shield : Depreciation is anon-cash expense (as is amortization, which we have been assuming herein to be zero), which is deducted fromoperating earnings befor eincome taxes. Therefore, we add back justthe tax savings that deprecia- tion provides but ignore depreciation itself. It is assumed that the (internal) analyst knows the firm’ s tax bracket. Depreciation is tax deductible and, as such pro- vides cash, but otherwise itself directly provides no cash. Youfound above an in-depth illustration of the “tax effect of depreciation,” absent other media. Y ou may wish to view that page again now. Note: EBITDA (1-T) + D (T) = EBIT (1-T) + D. (To prove this out, substitute in the equation the following values: EBIT = $100; D = $20; A = $0; and T = .30) The two phrases are mathematically equivalent but appear to have somewhat different connotations. In the latter case, EBIT appears to refer to accounting income, hence ourpreference forEBITDA , a more cash-oriented notion . In the latter for-213 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",
            "mulation , adding back depreciation, which is a non-cash expense, intuitively appears to contradict the aforesaid idea that depreciation does not provide cash flow , even though it does work out mathematically and conceptually . 3.Capital Expenditures : There are the three categories of capital expenditures (“Cap Ex”) , which we shall need to incorporate in the free cash flow projection. They are: 1. Maintenance 2. Replacement 3. Expansion Occasionally , the walls must be painted and the premises properly maintained . Roofs may blow of f, and machinery gaskets may “blow ,” requiring replacement .Expansion- aryinvestments may involve acquiring additional factory space or equipment, in order to increase production, and hence sales and profits. Maintenance and replacement expenditures are clearly necessary ; expansionary expenditures are discr e- tionary and are (generally) undertaken in order to provide growth, i.e., increased sales and profits. We would deduct necessary capital expenditures in order to arrive at free cash flow . Accounting rules do not require separating out necessary from discretionary capital expenditures ; any breakdown, if provided, may be found in the footnotes. This informa- tion will assist the analyst in gauging the firm’ s growth prospects. Absent this breakdown , the most common prac-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 214\n",
            "\n",
            "tice among analysts is to use allcapital expenditures in the formula, although this is a matter of analyst judgment. 4. Net W orking Capital : “Net working capital” may be defined as current assets less current liabilities (NWC = CA – CL). Any increase incurrent assets, or in net current assets (i.e., “NWC ”), usesfinancial resources and thus reduces cash or cash flow . For example, an increase in inventory uses funds. Similarly , an increase in current liabilities provides funds , and may be thought of as a “source” of funds. A decrease in current liabilities uses funds. For example, when a com- pany pays itsaccounts payable, it uses funds. If a firm is to grow it will have to increase its Net W orking Capital. The table below summarizes the possibilities and instructs you how to insert the changes into the FCF formula. Some add to FCF;others are subtracted from FCF. Note that, in calculating Free Cash Flow and the relevant prospective changes in Current Assets, we ignore expected changes in the cash account, focusing instead on changes inthecash flow af fecting the cash account. T o include changes in the cash account itself in calculating FCF, would be “double-counting.”215 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",
            "What can the corporation do with its FCF? •Purchase more P , P, & E. •Expand inventory . •Invest in Mer gers and Acquisitions (using shares when high-priced). •Increase R & D. •Pay of f Debt. •Pay discretionary (common stock) dividends. •Buy back common shares (when cheap). Apotential corporate investment project that throws of f a lot of FCF is desirable. A firm , as a whole, that throws of f lots of FCF may be thought of in a most positive light – as one, among other possibilities, that has a lot of growth potential and makes for a good investment.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 216\n",

            "9.3 F ree Cash Flow Ex ercises Free Cash Flow: Exercise #1 That covers the formula. Let us work up a quick , all inclu- sive, example. Y ou are given the following :solve for “free cash flow .”Assume that there is no amortization. [(EBITDA) (1 – T)] + [(Depr eciation) (T)] – [Necessary Capital Expenditur es] – [Incr ease in Net W orking Capital] FCF (Formulation) = $100 (1 – .30) + $1 (.30) – $7 – $2 (Calculation) = $70 + $0.30 – $7 – $2 = $61.3 million Working Capital next year versus this year increased by $2 million : (6-2) – (5-3) . Alternatively , one might say that current assets increased by $1 million, a useof funds; cur- rent liabilities decreased by $ 1 million, also a use of funds .217 Kenneth S.Bigel 217\n",
            "\n",
            "The net use of funds was therefore $2 million, which accordingly reduces free cash flow . To summarize, free cash flow may be thought of as the firm’ s after -tax cash flows less any spending on either the maintenance or replacement of fixed assets, and in acquir- ing working capital. The free cash flow left over may be used either to pay down debt, pay dividends, buy back stock, for discretionary growth investments and more. The firm will (should) choose investments that further maxi- mize FCF . This discussion has, so far , assumed that we, financial ana- lysts, are perfectly capable of making accurate, numerical projections about matters that have not yet occurred. In reality , projections are virtually always going to be some- what incorrect – when all is said and done. Projections “under uncertainty” are beyond this manual’ s scope. This example is generic in the sense that it may represent either the view of an external analyst looking at a cor- poration’ s most recent financial report, and, based on the report, making an assessment of the corporation’ s growth prospects and equity investment merits based on its FCF; or it could be a projection that an internal analyst makes for a potential corporate investment project.

Now , we will conduct an exercise, based on the earlier net income and EPS projections, in which we shall create a pro-forma statement – of a sort – of free cash flows for mul- tiple future years rather than just one year ’s net income. The figures for EBIT and Depreciation were calculated and the solutions can be found in Section #8.6; these figures are needed for the FCF problem herewith. This spreadsheet will be useful when, later , we assess such cash flows in present value terms in order to make capital investment decisions. In this connection, take note that interest, for example, is excluded from FCF because it is a capital cost, as discussed earlier .In order to do this, we need to recall the FCF formula. Here, once again, it is: [(EBITDA )(1 – T) ]+[(Depr eciation )(T)]–[Necessary Capital Expenditur es]–[Increase in Net W orking Capital ] In our pro-forma ,Five-year income statement, we have many of the elements: EBIT , depreciation, and tax rate (i.e., 40%) . Let us assume the following for the missing parts: 1.For EBIT and Depreciation figures, use the data calculated earlier – in Section #8.6. 2.There is no amortization. 3.Replacement and maintenance capital expendi- tures shall be $1,000 in “Y ear 1” and grow thereafter at a 5% rate. 4.Current Assets will increase in Y ear 1 by $500 the first year , and each year thereafter at a219 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

To make matters simple, a spreadsheet is provided below , which is consistent with the FCF formula. Notice the (hor- izontal) line breaks, which assist you in separating out the pieces of the formula from their respective sub-parts. Note also that cash outflows should be bracketed, since they are negative.

It cannot achieve a sales increase (“growth”) without adding on productive “capital assets ”(not to mention maintaining existing assets) in order to produce more goods for sale . Some further internal funds will be gen- erated by accounts payable, also in the normal course of business conduct. Payables are, essentially , free, short-term loans provided by the firm’ s suppliers for , usually , 30 days. Payables are, finan- cially speaking, (interest-) free sources of funds. W e call these funds, including payables and retained earnings, by numerous names: “spontaneous, auto- matic,” or “internal.” Some of the com- pany’ s capital needs will be met “spontaneously ,” in the normal course of doing business by retaining some, or all, of its earnings. Such funds may be thought of as having been generated “internally .”Introduction toFinancial Analysis 224 224\n",

The extent to which t hecompany will use either debt orequity ,and in what proportions, is the subject of the “Capi- talStructure ”topic; this topic will be dis- cussed later . The EFN projection is an essential component toof the corpora- tion’s capital planning . The EFN Formula :The formula, which we shall develop, consists of three parts. The first part tells us how much additional assets the firm will require in order to support a stated sales growth objective. This part is based on the firm’ s required ratio of assets to sales. It will need more assets in order to produce more sales. We shall refer to this amount as the “gross requirement,” for lack of a better phrase. The next two parts indicate the extent to which first, accounts payable, and second, retained earnings may reduce the gross requirement. After having reduced the gross requirement by the two internally generated or spon- taneous sources of funds, we are left with a figure, which tells us how much additional, external financing the firm will have to arrange for itself in order to achieve its pre- set sales growth objective. External financing will take the form of new debt and/or equity . EFN Model’ s Restrictive Assumption : We shall assume that Financial Ratios remain the225 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

Anexample of this is accounts payable. When a producer orders raw materials ,a free loan for usually thirty days is created by the supplier . Over the course of the year , and as the thirty days continually “roll over” over the course of the entire year ,the producing firm is supplied with a free source of “internal” funds.

            "9.5 Internal and External F unds (Summary) We said above that the firm may reduce its total require- ment for acquiring funds through the “spontaneous” or “automatic” generation of internal funds. Internal Funds : •Accounts Payable ◦If the firm bought supplies and raw or finished inventory etc. under “cash on delivery , or “COD,” terms of sale, it would have to pay for it – with cash! If it has enough cash, it will incur anopportunity costs , because the cash would not be invested. If it had to bor- row the money , it would incur an explicit borrowing cost at a rate of interest. However , most firms are pro- videdwith 30- day terms of sale from itssuppliers, which amounts to a 30-day free loan, during which time it incurs neither an opportunity –nor an explicit –cost. In this sense, credit terms – Accounts Payable – provide cash flow to the buying firm. The cor- poration receives a free loan, of a sort, from its suppliers. ◦Although the Accounts Payable will229 Kenneth S.Bigel 229\n",
            "\n",
            "be paid in 30-days ,the firm will have on average over the course of the year,30-days of access to a free source of funds. The firm, more or less simultaneously , pays down the Payables and then re-orders more goods. •Addition stoRetained Earnings ◦This, clearly , provides a stream of internal funds to the corpora- tionasprofits aremade and retained . We also said that, to the extent that internal funding is insuf ficient to satisfy all the investment needs, it may seek additional funding externally . External Funds : •Short-term bank lines of credit •Short-term bank loans – “notes” •Long-term (bank) loans – “debt” •Issuance (sale) of corporate notes or bonds •Issuance (sale) ofequityIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 230\n",

            "9.6 The EFN F ormula Explained The EFN F ormula Explained You will observe that the EFN formula has three parts (sep- arated by two minus signs). EFN= [(A 0/S0)ΔS)] –[(AP0/S0)ΔS] –[(M0) (S1) (RR0)] The first part represents the required increase in total assets [(A0/S0)ΔS)]needed to sustain the projected sales increase. Last year , assets equal to A 0were required by the firm to sustain asales level equal to S 0.Hence, we formu- late the ratio A0/S0. Assuming this ratio remains static, next year , the firm will require so much more in assets ; this is arrived at by multiplying the ratio by ΔS, the projected sales increase ;ΔS = S 1– S0. However , some of this “gross requirement ”will be “spon- taneously ” or “automatically” met by the normal business generation of “internal ”funds in the manner of sponta- neous liabilities, by which we primarily refer to accounts payable (not notes payable o r the current portion of long- term debt payable). Last year , such internal funds repre- sented a certain percentage of sales: (A0/S0). If we multiply this dollar figure by the projected sales increase (ΔS), we may see to what extent spontaneous liabilities reduce the original “gross requirement. ” Finally , the firm will also – hopefully – generate and retain231 Kenneth S.Bigel 231\n",
            "\n",
            "some of its earnings, thereby further reducing its “gross requirement .”If we take the firm ’s net profit mar gin(NI/S = M0)and multiply it by next year ’s sales (S1), we get next year’s projected net profits: ( M0) (S1)= NI 1.If we the net profit mar gin (i.e., M 0= NI/S) times next year ’s sales, we get next year ’snetprofits. I f we further multiply this by the firm’ s retention rate ( RR0), we get the firm’ s projected retained earnings. After all is said and done, we have a figure – the dollar amount of EFN – that enables the firm to plan for next year’s acquisition of external financing , and hence increased asset levels in support of the planned sales increase .Interesting ly, this formula does not instruct us relative to the extent to which the external requirement should be met by either debt or equity ,and in what Debt- to-Equity proportion. Note: For simplicity of presentation only ,below we will ignore the “rule” of using an average balance sheet datum when concocting mixed ratios ( i.e., those that include both bal- ance sheet and income statement data ).This simplifica- tionis in addition to the static analysis already assumed. Some useful formulae : •ΔS = S 1– S0 •M0= NI / S •RR = (NI – D) / NI = A.R.E. / NI = 1 – PRIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 232\n",

Answer : It means that, if my company wishes to grow its sales next year by $500, it will need to add on $250 worth of assets, of which $180.90 will be funded externally . Remember : If it wishes to increase assets by $250 in order to achieve its sales objective, it will have to increase the other side of the balance sheet by the same amount. In this case, $25 will be provided internally by accounts payable, $44.10 will be provided internally through retained earn- ings, and $180.90 will be provided externally by some mix of debt and equity .Introduction toFinancial Analysis 236 236\n",

Question #2: How much of the $180.90 will be externally funded by debt and how much by equity? Question #2, Answer 1: The present debt/equity ratio is 3:7, i.e., 30% debt and 70% equity . Total capital is $1,000, with $300 of debt and $700 of equity (D ÷ TA = 30%). Assuming static analysis, 30% of the $180.90 will be237 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",
            "financed by debt and 70% by equity . This will maintain the capital ratios in the same proportions as prior to the new external fund- ing. Question #2, Answer 2: Another , perhaps better , way of calculating the debt ratio, for this purpose, would be by excluding internal capital from the figures. In this way , we would be establishing only how much external debt and external equity should be raised, an approach, which would be more consistent with the purpose of the EFN formula. We agreed that the firm needs $180.90 of external funds. Thus presently , external debt ÷ external equity = 200 ÷ 500; that is 28.5% (2/7) in debt as compared to the total of external capital. We had raised $2 of external debt for every $5 of external equity . Total external capital was $700 (5/7) (not the $1,000 in total capi- tal used in the prior calculation). In this alternate calculation, we have ignored internal accounts payable ($100) and retained earn- ings ($200). Incremental internal funds will be provided over the coming year as in the past. Below we illustrate both answers. Note 2:Introduction toFinancial Analysis 238\n",
            "\n",
            "In the first two expressions in the EFN model, i.e., [(A0/S0) ΔS] and[(AP0/S0) ΔS], we utilize the incremental, projected sales increase (i.e., ΔS) whereas the third portion [ (M0) (S1)(1 – PR 0)], we utilize the entire projected sales amount (S 1). Why , in fact, may Financial Ratios change ? In the foregoing analysis, we assumed that financial ratios do not change over time. In fact, ratios are dynamic. Here are some reasons why , in fact, ratios will change. 1.Economies of scale – as companies grow lar ger and produce more, they benefit, according to Microeconomic theory , from lower production costs perunitproduced , even though total (production) costs are rising .The phenomenon will continue until the firm reaches full capacity and needs toadd on assets in order to continue growing. The Asset/Sales and Profit ratios will be af fected. Assets will remain flat as sales grow – until full capacity is reached . With unit costs down, gross profits will increase. 2.“Lumpy Assets” i.e., firms may reach a level where they have to acquire more (expensive) assets (assets don’ t grow smoothly or in the same propor- tion as the sales increase, which is likely smoother). For example, the factory may be at only 60% of capac-239 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",
            "ity, which af fords substantial growth in production and sales without adding on capacity or expanding to an addi- tional facility . Should sales continue to grow beyond present capacity , it would be incumbent upon the firm to add to its fixed assets at some point. Such assets would suddenly jump in size. Sales, by contrast, may grow rel- atively smoothly over time. The Sales/ Total Asset ratio will provide some insight. 3.Capital Costs (i.e., the economic costs to the corporation of borrowing money and issuing stock) will likely change over time – interest rates will go up and down, causing changes in the cost of debt, borrowed money . If the cost of debt decreases , after -tax income may increase. It will then be cheaper to finance new fixed assets, so the firm may then decide to add on more P , P, & E. The T .I.E. Ratio (EBIT / Interest Expense) may pro- vide some added insight here. Also, stock investors will demand that the company produce dividends and increased profits – to be retained if notIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 240\n",

In short, what investors require or demand, the corporation must provide; return to the investor is an economic costto the corporation.241 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

            "9.9 Summary: The F undamentals of Accounting and Financial Analysis This might be a good place to review what we have learned thus far . First, we highlighted some dif ficulties in reading financial statements fo rfinancial analysts. We did this by focusing on examples of current (inventory) and long-term asset accounting (depreciation) respectively .These high- lights assisted us in listing and understanding the four pri- mary issues related to accounting data interpretation namely , historical bias, the arbitrary use of cost method, and problems having to do with estimates and reserves. For us, the statements may not be what they seem ,with conse- quent reduced usefulness. If we are going to use accounting data as input sfor ratio analysis, wemust first and fore- most be cognizant of this, and (later) learn how toadjust the numbers, a skill, which you would acquire in aFinancial Statements Analysis course. Between highlighting accounting problems and presenting ratio analysis, we discussed the creation of pro forma financial statements and created a projected income state- ment. W e also looked at a model for projecting free cash flow, a very important predictor of a company’ s ongoing performance , and a metric by which possible investment projects are evaluated .Finally , we discussed the External Funds Needed model, an important tool in capital plan- ning in order to accommodate growth .Introduction toFinancial Analysis 242 242\n",

Of course it is! W e will often know the future pay- ments and wish to figure out the PV s!For example, you may wish to put aside some money for the down payment on a house in “ n” years. Assuming you know the “discount rate, ”how much must you set aside today in order to fund that amount? How much will you need to set aside today to fund your new- born child’ s college tuition? A bond pays interest every six months in a known amount. How much should you pay today in order to receive those future amounts? Solutions and Explanations : The $1 in the question is referred to as Present V alue (PV). The amount of money we will have in the future is referred to as Future V alue (FV). Remember , we are, so far , assum- ing that the interest payments are made at the endof each relevant payment period.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 258\n",

This was represented by the formula: $1 (1.10) = $1.10 . We noted that if the investor had invested for two years (again at 10% per year) hewould have $1.21. This was rep- resented by: $1 (1.10) 2= $1.21 .In other words, in the first year, s/he earned $0.10 in interest, while in the second year , he earned $0.1 1. Why does he earn more interest in the sec- ond year if the interest rate – 10% – remains the same? In the second year ,heonce again receives $0.10 interest on his principal investment of $1. However , since hehas already earned $0.10 of interest from the prior year ,hewill also earn 10% on that dime! That is equal to another penny of interest earned: ($0.10) (10%) = $0.01.

Or do we need to solve the problem mathematically (or by financial calculator)? One way to get around this is by estimating the multiplier by means of averaging the two whole multipliers that bracket the fractional one in question. W e call this process “interpolation” because we insert the average number in between the relevant values or factors, which are stated in the table. Let’ s use the future value table below to illustrate this. Futur e Value Factors What is the appropriate, estimated future value multiplier for 10 years at 9.5%? This can be approximated by taking the simple average of the multipliers for 9% and 10%: (2.3674 + 2.5937) ÷ 2 = 2.4806 This is only an estimate. Remember that time value factors increase (in this case – or decrease in the case of present values) at an exponential rate. The true mathematical future value for 9.5% for 10 years is:Introduction toFinancial Analysis 278 278\n",

W e first note that the simple average pro- duces a higher number than the true, exponential figure; this is notable. This is as expected because, in dealing with future value factors, the numbers grow exponentially or more quickly , and thus we would start of f with a lower number . Put dif ferently , we do not grow from 9% to 10% at a linear rate, but at an increasing, curvilinear rate.279 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

            "10.12 Interpolation Illustr ated Interpolation may be useful in order to estimate future (and present-) values when one does not wish, or have the abil- ity, to calculate more precise measures. The reason for the error has to do with the curvilinear relationship between (discount- and) compound interest rates and their related multipliers. This is best seen by illustration. One may readily see that, by connecting the asterisks, the interpolated value of 2.4806 resides on a straight line between the correctly calculated future value multipliers for 9% and 10% respectively . However , the time value of money is not linear . Any time an exponent is involved, you will not get a linear rela- tionship, but a curvilinear outcome of some sort. Hence, the correct multiplier for 9.5% is 2.4782, which is lowerIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 280 280\n",

If one joins the asterisks for 9% and 10% to the mathematically calculated middle value of 2.4782 (represented by “#”), one readily observes the curvilinear relationship between compound interest rates and their respective multipliers. In short, as rates increase, future values increase in non-linear fashion. Correspondingly , present values would decrease non-linearly .

For example, a five-year IOU with a future value of $1,000, using the tables, would have a present value of $1,000 (0.7835) = $783.50 – at a discount rate of 5%. The IOU could be purchased or sold for that amount, or price. Think of present value as an item’ s dollar price. If the discount rate instead were 10%, the present value would be only: $1,000 (0.6209) = $620.90. In percentage terms, the pre- sent value of $1,000 to be received five years from now , discounted at a rate of 5% is greater than at 10% by a dif- ference of (783.5 ÷ 620.9) – 1 = 26.2%. If however the IOU had a 30-year term, the dif ference in present value would itself compound. At 5%, the present value would equal $1,000 (0.2314) = $231.40. At 10%, the PV would equal $1,000 (0.0573) = $57.30. In percent- age terms, the present value of $1,000 to be received thirty years from now , discounted at a rate of 5% is greater than at 10% by a dif ference of (231.4 ÷ 57.30) – 1 = 303.8% .Introduction toFinancial Analysis 284 284\n",

By geometry here we refer to its non-linear and exponential nature. Whenever there is an exponent in aformula, we get some kind of curve . As time increases, dif ferences in present- and future-values for a given number of years themselves increase non-linearly . If you had purchased a thirty-year IOU as an investment, any changes in interest rates (i.e., due to market conditions) would have a far greater impact on the value of your IOU investment than if you had, instead, purchased a five-year obligation. For a given change in discount rates of interest, the impact on the multipliers is greater the greater the time is. The impact on price, which is present value, is greater , the greater the time–period . “Price volatility ,” so to speak, increases as the future payment grows more distant. Again, this is because, the time value of money is non-lin- ear; it is exponential. W e are dealing, quite literally , with compound interest, i.e., interest on the interest.

You would then arrive at the future- or present-values of the cash flows, in one step. Such annuity interest tables exist ; a link is provided at the bottom of this page. What may we observe from this table? Future value annu- ity factors are always greater than the number of periods. Here the FVF was 3.31, or greater than n · p = 3 periods. This is because the annuity multiplier is the sum of each respective yearly factor , each of which is greater than 1.0 (except the last one, which = 1.0) since they are all multi- ples of (1 + R)n. (This assumes that R > 0.) Contrarily , each PVF is less than the number of periods because the respective factors are all less than 1.0, as each factor is the reciprocal of (1 + R)n. (Again, this assumes that R > 0.) When utilizing a table, it is always a good idea to “eyeball”299 Kenneth S.Bigel 299\n",

Let’ s assume that the Cash Flows are to be received at the end of the respective periods. In the examples following, there are five cash flows. Compounding : There are, altogether , four compounding “periods”; the last cash flow to be received is not compounded because it is received at the “horizon” of the deal. Indeed, the last CF does have a zero-exponent attached to it: [1 + R]0= 1. The exponents are zero through four . Discounting : In contrast, there are five discounting periods.

(See the table at the bot- tom of this page for a key summary of the dif ferences in exponents.) Since an annuity due provides each of its cash flows one period earlier than the ordinary annuity , the PV and FV of the annuity is equal to the respective ordinary annuity factors multiplied by (1 +R/p)1.

In the case of the FV , there will be more compounding periods, hence the FV is also higher . Again, in both instances, the ordinary annuity factor is adjusted by a multiple of (1 +R/ p)1.

For example, if the cash flows are $100 and the discount rate is 10%, the PV would be: PV = $100 ÷ .10 = $1,000 The general formula would thus be: PV = CF ÷ i This works because of the mathematical “law of limits. ” Simply put, as the cash flows grow more distant, the respective PVs of these cash flows approach zero. Adding increasingly distant cash flows will have an infinitesi- malimpact on the outcome, the present value. Thus, theIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 324 324\n",

An annuity of 25 years has a PV of $907.70 and a 50-year annuity would be $991.48. As time goes on, the PV of each additional year ’s cash flow becomes very , very small (i.e., time increases, PV decreases) so that adding such infinites- imal amounts provides no material addition to the aggre- gate. In the end, you will note that the above present values, when aggregated, will eventually approach, and theoreti- cally equal $1,000.

W e have also provided both the algebraic derivation of this formula and a discussion as to how the present value of a perpetu- ity approaches (but never quite reaches) the price described by the formula. Still, many students find the idea of limits – and of the infinitesimal – dif ficult to grasp. Our intent here is to fur- ther elucidate the notion that present values decrease over time with the result that distant cash flows become so small, so infinitesimal – they have so many decimal places – that they add virtually nothing to the aggregate present value. In making this observation, you will also note that, as a result, the cumulative value of the perpetuity’ s present value approaches the theoretical price described by the for- mula, as posited by mathematicians. This is as it should be. Let us say that a perpetuity’ s cash flows are $1 and the interest rate at which we shall discount the series is 10%. The present value therefore would be: P 0= $1 ÷ .10 = $10. This is confirmed in the table below .Introduction toFinancial Analysis 326 326\n",

If, in the last period, we received a cash flow of $100 and its growth rate is 5%, the next cash flow would follow this formula: (Last Cash flow: CF 0) (1 + g) = Cash flow in next period (CF 1). “G” represents a constant rate of growth in the cash flow over time. CF1= CF 0(1 + g) $105 = $100 (1.05) The formula for a growth-perpetuity is: (Cash flow next period ) ÷ (Discount rate – Growth rate). Symbolically , this may be expressed as: PV = CF 1÷ (r– g) In the above example ( where r= 0.10 ), if the growth rate had been 5%, the present value would be (assuming here that the next CF is $105, that is, [$100] [1.05] = $105): $105 ÷ (.10 –.05) = $2,100 Notice that for this formula to work, “ g” cannot equal or exceed “ r.” Mathematically , ifgexceeds rwe would get a negative denominator , resulting in a negative present value, which makes no sense.

One, theoretically ,earns some positive return – “ r”–for investing in a no-risk asset1 ;otherwise ,no one would invest at all. Even with no risk (and no growth!) , there is a positive return. Therefore r>g.Asgrowth rates increase (in linear manner) , so too does risk; higher growth rates are more dif ficult to achieve and hence are riskier .R(“r”) should exceed g, as a practical, non-mathematical matter . This is depicted in the diagram below . This formula may also come in handy for cases of negative gr owth . Since “ g” would be negative, in this case, the for- mula would require that one add the growth rate to the interest rate in order to determine the present value. Suppose the last cash flow (CF0) was $100 , there is a nominal cash flow growth rate of negative 5%,and a discount rate of 10%. What would the present value be? 1.As this is being written (2021), we observe an unusual environment wherein interest rates in many parts of the world are negative.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 330\n",

Note : Looking at this graph alone one may conclude that, at some point, r<g. This is because the line is steeper than at a hor- izontal plane, thus, there would be less “rise” than “run,” leading eventually to growth exceeding the discount rate, and producing a negative present value. While this may be true if one limits the analysis to the graph alone, it cannot be correct ,in fact ,that dividend growth is not reflected in return – which is also the discount rate , and part of the denominator . As dividends rise, so too must return. (Remember: discounting and compounding are the same; just the arrows go in dif ferent directions.)

But let’ s not stop here! Occasionally , cash flows may occur before the end of a period. Suppose you earn 10% per year , compounded daily . What would be the FV after ¾ of a year? If we assume a 360-day year13, ¾×360 = 270 days. (In short-term financial analysis, we often deal with, or oth- erwise assume, twelve 30-day months to a year .) Further , 10% ÷360 = .0002777.

W ithmost loans, interest is paid over the term ,or life ,of the loan, and the entire principal is paid in one fell swoop at the loan’ s term,or maturity .In contrast, mortgages are self-amortiz- ing, which means that all payments include portions of both interest and principal, resulting in decreasing princi- pal balances over time until, at maturity , the entire loan will have been paid of f. Let us see, by way of (an unrealistic) example how this may work. Given: Principal: $100,000 Rate: 9 % Term: 10 Years Period: Yearly Mathematical Rationale : The loan proceeds, i.e., $100,000 in this case, represent the present value. The “periodic payment” represents the annu- ity payments to be made over future years and will include both Interest and Amortization .Amortization goes toward the reduction of the loan or principal balance.

Each year the annuity installment is first used to pay the interest on the loan and the balance i sused to reduce the capi tal outstanding .This continues for each period until maturity .

Tax deductibility is important simply because it reduces the after -tax cost of the mortgage. Funds that would otherwise have gone to pay tax instead go to debt service. This benefit is reduced as the interest portion of the mortgage payment is reduced with time. 2.Partway through the loan, half the loan will have been paid of f. A mortgage has a kind of “half- life.” In the foregoing example, half the loan will have been paid of f after six years. This half- lifewill be greater than half the length of the mortgage because initially the annuity payments are used mainly to pay interest on the loan! 3.Total interest paid may be much greater than and in longer -term cases, a multiple of the principal – this can be calculated by evaluating the total payments minus the principal. In the foregoing example, over the ten years the borrower will have paid a total of 10 annual payments of $15,576.32 for a total of $155,763.20. If you subtract from this figure theloan principal of $100,000, you are left with a figure of337 Kenneth S.Bigel 337\n",
            "\n",
            "$55,763.20, which represents the total amount of interest paid over the life of the mortgage (unadjusted for time value). In other words, interest paid represents an addi- tional 55% approximately of the principal borrowed. (W e take note again that most mortgages require monthly pay- ments and that, in today’ s marketplace, most mortgages are 15to 30 years. ) Let us compare 15- and 30-year mortgages in terms of the ratio of interest payments made relative to theprincipal. We remind ourselves that in the above instance (10 years and 9%) we had 55% interest payments relative to the loan principal. Let us use $100,000 ofprincipal again, and, this time, 6% in interest. W e shall again employ the formula: Principal ÷ PV Annuity Factor = Periodic Payment 15 years :($100,000) ÷ (9.7122) = $10,296.33 Over 15 years total payments will equal (15) ($10,296.33) = $154,444.95. In this case, interest payments will equal 54.44% of the principal. 30 years :($100,000) ÷ (13.7648) = $7,264.91 Over 30 years, total payments will equal (30) ($7,264.91) = $217,947.30. In this case, interest payments will equal 117.95% of the principal. Even though the annual payments are less in the 30-year case, we see that interest payments multiply enormously over time.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 338\n",

Here we focused on a single variable – time – which greatly impacts the scenario depicted relative to the minimal impact that a small premium interest rate would have for the increased term to maturity . •Taxation will also have an ef fect.

It is cen- tral to all of financial analysis and must be mastered. It is a basic tool. In th e prior two chapters , we developed a rationale for assessing “simple” future- and present-values. W e defined the two qualifications for a cash flow series’ being cate- gorized as an annuity , and then defined an ordinary annu- ity as the sum of the series’ present- and future-values. W e further defined “annuities due” and outlined a means for converting an ordinary annuity into an annuity due. Addi- tionally , we determined how interest rate tables may be used as a shortcut tool for calculating thetime value of money . Then we assessed uneven cash flow series that do not qual- ify as annuities. W e examined two cases of perpetuities (no-growth and growth) as a special case of annuity . We examined fractional time periods and discovered the arbi- trary nature of certain time value calculations, which have to do with the varying conventions regarding the definition of “period” and the use of interest rates in this regard. Finally , an illustration of a mortgage was presented and evaluated. “Before one continues further in this text, it is imperative345 Kenneth S.Bigel 345\n",

            "12.2 Security Return: The Holding Pattern Return (Ra w Calculation) In order to figure the return o nan asset (a percent) , it is useful to first outline the various components of the return onthe asset – and then to calculate the return. The two principal components of return are income and profit, i.e., sales or “exit” price less investment cost . Income is com- mon to many assets including bonds (interest) , stocks (div- idends) , and real estate (rent) . The exit price may be equal to, greater or less than the asset’ soriginal investment cost , hence “profit” is included in return . Example : •Stock/bond/real estate cost or investment (C) = $1,000. This is an “outflow .” •Income (I) received over the course of the hold- ing period = $100. •Sales (exit) price (P) = $1,050. •The income and sales price are “inflows.” Holding Period Return (HPR) : HPR = inflows ÷ outflows -1 = [(I + P) / C] – 1353 Kenneth S.Bigel 353\n",
            "\n",
            "HPR = [(100 + 1,050) / 1,000] – 1 = + 15% Alternatively , we could have calculated the HPR by focus- ing only on the profit ( “Π”), in which case, we would have left out the “-1” expression at the end. Note that the profit = $1.050 – $1,000 = $50. The result is the same this way as depicted below . HPR = [(I + Π) / C] HPR = [(100 + 50) / 1,000] = + 15% Note : In either application, this is a “raw” calculation in that it does not account for the time value of money . This approach ignores the length of the holding period and the timing of the cash flows. Clearly one would rather earn the raw 15% return over a shorter period than longer . Would you rather 15% over one year or ten? A dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar earned tomorrow . While the HPR has severe conceptual limits, it provides key information upon which a better model may be con- structed. In this section, we will present the calculation for dollar price and return of a bond.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 354\n",

            "12.3 V aluation Premise So, the HPR is not acceptable because it does not include the critical notion of time value of money . In general, we will find that the (dollar -) valuation of any asset will adhere to the following rule: The value of an (financial) asset is equal to the future cash flows the asset is expected to produce, each of which cash flow is discounted to its present value and then all such present values are aggregated to a single value. This says that in valuing an asset, we must first identify its future cash flows, and then discount each of those cash flows at an appropriate discount rate, and aggregate the figures into a sum, which shall be the asset’ s valuation or price. We will also find that, in a certain sense, the dollar value and the discount rate are interchangeable; in fact, we will note that the discount rate, in a lar ge sense, is the “true” price of the asset.

            "12.4 Fix ed Income Securities: Bond Components and V aluation F ormula Since the coupon cash flow of a bond constitutes an annu- ity,thecalculat ion of a bond’ sdollar price involves a sim- ple solution: The above formula says that every (annuity) coupon pay- ment plus the one-time face value payment arediscounted and aggregated to present value, which is the bond’ s price. This is based on our “valuation premise.” Here are some important terms to know: Face V alue = Maturity V alue = Par V alue = Principal : These phrases are synonymous and interchangeable. Matu- rity value is the amount of money the investor , or bond- holder /lender , gets back when the bond matures. This represents , in most instances (and herewith) a one-time cash inflow to the investor . Coupon Rate ( C)=Interest Rate (I) : This is the amount of interest that the bond pays. (An exception would be a vari- able rate, but we do not deal with that here.) The dollar amount paid is this rate times the face value. Thus, if theIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 358 358\n",
            "\n",
            "rate is 10% and the Face V alue is $1,000, it will pay $100 per year . If this bond pays semi-annually , the investor will receive two $50 payments peryear, one every six months. This represents an annuity series of cash flows for the life of the bond; this is the bond’ s second set of cash flows. Yield-to-Maturity (YTM) =Market Rate = Discount Rate:This is the market-determined rate at which the bond’ s cash flows – both the Face V alue and the coupon payments – are “priced ,”or discounted , to present value. Do not confuse coupon and market rates; they are separate and mathematically distinct. The market yield will con- stantly change. Coupons are (generally) fixed. We may think of Face V alueand the bond’ sDollar Price in terms of $100s or $1,000s or any multiple thereof. Since the bond’ s price is expressed in terms of 100% of the bond’ s “Par” value, it doesn’ t matter for calculation pur- poses, how many zeros we add on in an illustration or exer- cise. This will be demonstrated immediately below . The bond trader will quote the bond in terms of a percent of par and will then ask the buyer or seller what the “size” of the trade is? In other words ,how much they are dealing with. Of course , in reality ,buying or selling a thousand ,or a million ,dollars ’worth of bonds matters a great deal.

The “true” price of the bond may , in fact, be considered the YTM. It is conceivable that there exist two bonds with the same maturity (or even issued by the same company) but due to having been issued at dif ferent times, the two bonds carry dif ferent coupons.

            "12.6 Bond Dollar Prices: Discount, P ar, and Premium In the case of investment grade bonds (but not in the case of “junk bonds”) ,corporate issuers usually endeavor to set the coupon so that the initial of fering price for the new bond at the time of issuance is Par (100% of the b ond’s face value) . The coupon and other important terms of the underwriting are written into a legal document called the indentur e. Once the indenture is completed, prospective bonds investors are provided with a “prospectus, ”which lays out the terms of the bond ,thefinancial condition of the com- pany ,and other important facts. Investors have some time until the bond is issued in which to decide whether they wish to purchase the bond or not. In this short time, market yields are subject to fluctuation. As a result, at the ultimate time of issue, the coupon rateand the contemporary mar- ket yield (Y ield-To-Maturity or“YTM” ) will likely have diver ged. Therefore, it is not terribly common to see new bonds being issued at aprice of precisely Par; this of course results in new issue prices being ateither discounts orpremia to Par . There are these two possibilities. Moreover , over the life of the bond, market yields may diver gestillfurther from the coupons. For example, w hen an investor purchases an “old” bond, which may have been issued when market yields – and hence coupons – were lower , it may be looked at as inferior365 Kenneth S.Bigel 365\n",

            "to newer bonds in that its coupon pays less than bonds issued today with the same maturity and credit rating. This iswhy –mathematically –such lower paying bonds trade at a discount to par .You get less (i.e., a lower coupon rate of interest than the current YTM ),so you pay less .Of course, this is also true in reverse. Similarly , for premium bonds, you pay more, because you get more (coupon than the current YTM ). The time value of money discount rate (i.e., YTM) is the great equalizer .You may take two bonds that are similar in all respects except the coupon ;they will trade at the same market yield ,as they should ,by definition ,buttheir dollar prices will dif fer. Therefore, the “true” price of a bond is the YTM! While many people believe that bond prices are stable, any volatility can increase investment risk relative to bond port- folios. V olatility may stem from default risks and macro- economic causes and willbe reflected as changes in YTM. You get more (Coupon than Market Y ield) you pay more!Introduction toFinancial Analysis 366\n",

            "12.7 The T rue Price of a Bond Once again, it may be said thatthe“true price” of a bond is its yield-to-maturity . YTM is the means by which the bond’ s cash flows are discounted or “priced.” Two bonds may have the same credit rating and maturity but may have been issued at dif ferent times and thus will have dif ferent coupon rates, and therefore will be valued at different dollar prices even though, themarket yields today are the same for both . To illustrate this, solve the following problem for two bonds. Y ou will note that the YTM sand TTMs for each of the two bonds in the example are the same, but the coupons differ,causing the dollar prices todiffer. We assume equal creditability for each. YTM = 4% N = 10 P = 2 Cpn. Bond #1 = 4% Cpn. Bond #2 = 0% Solve this without glancing at the solutions.367 Kenneth S.Bigel 367\n",

Return to investors represents cost to the cor- porations that issue the securities; they are the two sides to the same coin. As in the case of “return on investment,” the phrases “return” and “cost of capital” to a corporation are described in percentage terms, i.e., as a rate, and not as a dollar amount. Cost of capital refers to the weighted-aver- age cost of the corporation’ s debt and equity . Both debt and equity provide the corporation with funds with which to acquire assets, so that the corporation may grow . Investors who provide these funds to the corporation expect a return on their investment; this return represents an “economic cost” to the corporation.

            "Key Terms: Cost of Debt Capi- tal Cost of Equity Capital Required Return Risk-free•Thecost of equity capital includes the dividends paid to investors plus their expectation sof capital gains resulting from the growth in earnings. Remember , shareholders may expect to receive divi- dends and to see additions to retained earnings. Should the investors’ expecta- tions, which we may also view as their minimum required return, not be met, they may sell the security . Investors expect that retained earn- ings and other capital sources be productively employed in the growth of the company so that their shares’ value increases – due to increased earnings and growth expectations. Cor- porations therefore must provide the assurance of price appreciation, or shareholders will sell, and/or hire new managers and directors. This prospective price appreciation is also part of the firm’ s capital costs, as viewed from the economist’ s eye. In general, the requir ed return (R) whether for stocks or bonds, con- sists of two parts: one, a return associated with the “risk-free” instrument and the risk-fr ee rate of return (RF); the other , a premium, or extra, return for incremental risk above zero-risk.

Even though the zero- risk investment has no risk (excuse the redundancy), it still provides a positive rate of return. If it provided no return, no one would invest in it. There is no agreement about the real-world proxy for the risk-free instrument; it is usually taken as either the three-month T reasury Bill, or the ten- year T reasury Note. More precisely , the risk-free instru- ment’ s expected and required returns will be the same, and the standard deviation of its return will be zero. Again, the Market Risk Pr emium (MRP) will be the dif ference between the risk-free and market rates of return. In other words, the market return provides a premium or additional return to the investor for taking on a level of risk greater than zero. Any particular invest- ment, or portfolio of investments, may provide more, or less, risk and return than the overall market. In such cases, the investor ’s portfolio may contain a level of risk greater than or less than the market ’s risk level , i.e., to the right or left of the Market Risk on the horizontal axis. Accordingly , the investor may expect to earn more than the market return ,or less. The investor ’s expected return will then be either above o rbelow the Market Return375 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

Take note, once again, of the odd use of the term “risk premium” rel- ative to additional return. The more risk one takes on, the proportionally greater should the return be. This is due to the notion of Rational Expectations . One might say that to accept more risk for no added return is irrational, and no one would do that. That is why the slope of the diagonal is positive. The diagonal market line in the diagram reflects this positive risk/reward relationship. The more the risk, the more the (expected) return. •Many researchers will use the 3-month T reasury Bill as the proxy for the theoretical risk-free instrument. This choice has to do with three explanations. ◦First, the United States T reasury is considered the least risky of all debtors (although that may no longer be true). ◦Second, because the 3-month term is so short, market price fluctuation is not at issue; in a very short while, the bills will mature and pay their full, face value.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 376\n",

Some argue for the use of the 10-Y ear T reasury Note as the real –world equivalent of the risk-free instrument . This is because Equities tend to be longer-term investments and, more importantly , because Credit Spreads (to be discussed in a later chapter) are usually figured in a ten-year timeframe.

            "13.4 Fix ed Income Risks Risk in theoretical finance is defined mathematically usu- ally as the chance or extent to which the actual return may differ from the required or expected return. “Differ” allows for the actual or “realized” return to be either less or greater than the expected return. From the investor ’s perspective, bond risks may be divided into the following qualitative components: Liquidity Risk – the risk that the security cannot be con- verted to cash at its reasonable intrinsic or “fair market value” due, possibly , to a lack of buyers. Credit- or Default Risk – the possibility that a corporation may, in the worst case, go bankrupt, or , in a lesser case, not honor its interest and other related payments timely and in full. ◦If the firm is in violation of any of the technical terms (“covenants”) of its loan agreement (“indenture”), it may also be considered in “techni- cal-” default even if it is timely in making all its payments. ◦Note that interest must be paid before any dividend payments on preferred and common stocks mayIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 380 380\n",

Inflation Risk – the risk that the return , i.e., theinterest payments, will be eroded over time by inflation, i.e., a reduction in the purchasing power of the interest payments . ◦Note that, in most cases, interest payments are fixed. ◦Many governments sell inflation- linked, or inflation-indexed bonds that have payouts linked to the inflation rate. The United States Treasury sells T reasury Inflation- Protected Securities (TIPS). Inter est Rate (or “Price”) Risk – the negative ef fect on market value s,or price s,due to rising levels ofgeneral interest rates. ◦Interest rates and prices are inversely related. If rates go up, ceteris paribus, bond market prices go down. ◦Think of it this way: If you already own a bond and interest rates, in general, go up since the time of pur- chase, then new bonds will be issued at higher rates than your bond. All else equal, that will make your bond relatively less attractive381 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

            "and thus its market value will go down. ◦Possibly more than any other risk, this is tied into macroeconomic fac- tors, including Federal Reserve policies. Reinvestment Rate Risk – the risk that cash interest pay- ments received during the life of a bond will be reinvested at less than the rate originally expected, thereby reducing the overall holding period return . ◦When the investor purchases a bond, s/he has some expectation to either spend the money or to rein- vest the interest payments at some anticipated future rate. Should rates go down, the reinvestment rate will be less than expected (or less than it was at the time of purchase) and the investor ’s savings at the bond’ s maturity (i.e., the bond’ s “future value”) will have accumulated to less than that which was originally anticipated. ◦Note that interest rate and reinvest- ment risks are inversely related to (i.e., the opposite of) one another .

If in general, interest rates go up, market prices for existing, “older” bonds will go down – and vice versa. General inter- est rates and bond prices are inversely related. In an envi- ronment where market rates have gone up, bond investors holding “old” bonds will receive less interest income than if they had purchased “new” bonds that were issued more recently – at higher (coupon) rates. This will cause market values for existing bonds to go down; they are simply worth less competitively . Rising rates are “bad” news for (existing) bondholders in terms of interest rate risk. However , bondholders will be able to reinvest their interest proceeds at higher rates than before if rates rise. Investors receive regular , periodic interest payments over the life of the bond, which upon receipt, is assumed to be reinvested into other alternatives that pay higher rates than before. Thus, rising rates are “good” news for bondholders – in terms of reinvestment risk. In short, interest rate and reinvestment risks are inversely related to one another .

            "13.6 Credit Ratings Corporations are rated by credit-rating agencies that assess a corporation’ s ability to service its debt (i.e., to pay inter- est and principal in full and on time) and, thus, to avoid a default and to ultimately keep bankruptcy at bay . This is a risk, which may also be referred to as “default risk.” We have already examined three solvency ratios which attempt to provide some insight into this risk. Clearly , there are many more tools and considerations that enter into the process of credit analysis and rating. Companies must pay for this service, but not all do so, as some bond issues are too small to justify the expense, while others may be sold directly to institutional investors and thus do not require a rating. Today , there are two major rating agencies: Standard & Poor ’s (S&P) and Moody’ s.Fitch is still a third agency , but it does not enjoy the market presence of the others. In addition, there are numerous nationally recognized statisti- cal rating or ganizations or “NRSRO’ s” that perform similar functions (see: https://www .sec.gov/ocr/ocr -current- nrsros.html ). The agencies rate bonds on the scale illus- trated below . As you will note, there are some dif ferences in the rating scales, and, although not visible in the ratings themselves, the manners in which the agencies conduct their respective analyses and what they consider important also dif fer from one agency to the other . As a result, the agencies may not rate the same bond issuer the same.387 Kenneth S.Bigel 387\n",
            "\n",
            "Within each rating category , the agencies may append addi- tional notation, such as “A-” in the case of S&P . This pro- vides some further refinement to the ratings. Note: The “S&P 500” is a stock index and does not apply to bonds. Ratings will clearly af fect the bond’ s yield – in inverse relation to the rating, with lower ratings generally bringing higher yields. That is to say thatthe lower the cr edit rating, the higher the default risk. A gr eater default risk means a lower dollar price, which, in turn means a higher yield. The better the bond’ s initial rating, the lower the bond’ s coupon rate of interest, and, of course, the lower the issuer ’s cost of debt capital; this is alsoIntroduction toFinancial Analysis 388\n",

The coupon determines how much the interest bond pays, whereas the YTM is the ever -changing market discount rate which is used to price the bond. The rating agencies do not collude or necessarily agree with one another; in some cases, the agen- cies may rate the same company somewhat dif fer- ently . Interestingly , the bond market itself seems to understand what the true yield for a bond should be; indeed, yields often adjust long before a rating change (i.e., either an upgrade or a downgrade) announcement. Further , a bond’ s rating is not nec- essarily “correct.” In the case of municipal bonds, the agencies con- duct similar analyses and provide similar ratings. The interpretation of municipal ratings, however , is somewhat dif ferent in practice, with municipal bonds less likely to default than their ratings might imply . In some instances, municipal bonds may be insured by private insurance companies, in most of which cases the bonds will therefore bear a “AAA” rating regardless of its intrinsic creditabil- ity. Most insurers are considered to be in the best financial health. United States T reasury and Agency bonds are highly rated but are no longer perceived as being completely risk free. In 201 1, Standard & Poor ’s389 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",
            "Key Terms Covenants Indenturelowered its rating for T reasury Securities from AAA to AA+. The agency felt that the congres- sional deadlock in arriving at a budget agreement warranted the downgrade. Since then, the agency has not upgraded the rating back to AAA. The other rating agencies have kept the T reasury’ s rat- ing at AAA. “Agencies” are considered slightly lower in quality than “Treasuries” and will therefore trade at very slightly higher yields. The markets “know” how to price their securities based on YTM and its associated default risk. While the rating agencies do not provide the details of the manner in which they conduct their ratings, it is accepted that their formulae consist of a combination of the exami- nation of the issuer ’s financial health (based on its financial statements), its economic environment, and an examination of the bond’ s covenants. Covenants are agreed-upon terms to which the issuer assures it will adhere; in a way it is a restriction imposed by the lender in order to secure or strengthen his position. For instance, the issuer may assure the investors that its financial ratios will remain within certain parame- ters, or that it will not issue any further debt, which shall be senior to the issue at hand. In general, such negative covenants will also prohibit the firm from paying too much in dividends, selling or pledging assets to other lenders, maintaining collateral in good condition, or adding on more debt.

            "In Default Technical Defaultand principal payments wo uld certainly be included in this category .These assurances are spelled out in the bond indentur e, a legal document in which all the terms of the bond issue are spelled out, including the bond’ s maturity and coupon interest rate. Although a bond issuer , or borrower , may pay its bond interest in full and on time, which is to say it is not indefault ,any violation of any of the bond indenture’ s covenants may be interpreted as a techni- cal default and result in a downgrading of the bond’ s credit rating. The bond covenants are aimed at providing investors with reasonable assurances of the issuer ’s fealty to its obligations under the bond, but not so much as to disenable it from running its business ef fectively . Failure to abide by the covenants is, thus, a negative circumstance . The restrictiveness of the bond’ s covenants will vary . Secured, or asset-backed ,securities will have less restric- tive covenants than unsecured issues. Furthermore, lower rated, non-investment grade, bonds are likely to be more restrictive and more complex, and hence will require a more careful reading prior to purchase and investment. Evaluation of these risk iersecurities’ covenants is rela- tively more important than in the case of investment grade bonds. Moody’ s places some emphasis inthe determination of its ratings for high-yield bonds on the issue’ s covenants. High yield bonds tend to attract more sophisticated investors who are capable of studying the technical terms of the covenants; moreover , many such issues are placed privately among institutional investors.391 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",
            "LienInvestment grade bonds will typically contain three standard covenants. First, there may be a covenant regarding “ liens, ” which assure the investor that no other party may obtain a “senior” (prior) claim to the asset (or collateral) subsequent to the bond’ s issuance. Under the law, alienis a claim by a person upon another person’ s property for purposes of securing pay- ment of a debt or the fulfillment ofan obligation. If there is aprior lien on a property , no other person can subse- quently make a claim on the same property . By manner of another example, when you buy a house, your attorney will conduct a “lien search,” to be sure that no one else owns the house except the seller with whom you are dealing. Next, a covenant will protect against any reduction in seniority of the bond in case of a mer ger of the issuer with another corporation. This covenant will ensure that the bond is paid of f first in any case. Finally , another covenant may address the sale of an under- lying asset – in the case of a secured bond. Obviously , should an asset underlying a collateralized bond be sold, the bond’ s financial status will change markedly . Such assets ought not to be sold unless the bond is also redeemed. There is no doubt that credit ratings are critical to pricing primary and secondary market issues. Ratings influence both the coupon rates of interest in the primary market, and market yields, or yields-to-maturity in the secondary mar- kets.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 392\n",

            "Key Terms: Yield Curve Yield-to- Maturity Term-to- Maturity 13.7 The Yield Curv e TheYield Curve depicts the relationship between Yield-to-Maturity (YTM) and Term (or Time)- to-Maturity (TTM) for a given class of bond, such as T reasury Notes and Bonds, Municipal Bonds, or Corporate Bonds .When one speaks of the Yield Curve without specifying the instrument, it is assumed to refer to the market for T reasury securities. The yield usually is stated in nominal terms, i.e., not in real terms, which would adjust for inflation. The horizontal axis is the term, orTime-to-M aturity (TTM), and the vertical is Yield-to-M aturity (YTM) or market yield . The slope of the yield curve can be flat, positive (upward sloping) or negative. It may , at times, be kinked. As will be shown later, YTM will determine the dollar -price for a given bond. Under “normal” circumstances, the yield curve will reflect an upward, but not nec- essarily linear , slope; that is, as maturities get longer , yields will also rise. The the- ory of Liquidity Pr eference attempts to explain this. Investors prefer being liquid rather than illiquid. When liquid, investors have the entire range of options available to them; they may either spend393 Kenneth S.Bigel 393\n",

            "Liquidity Preference Inverted Yield Curveor invest their money .When illiquid, choices and alternatives are reduced or eliminated. The longer one ties up his money , the greater his illiquidity . As one ’s illiquidity increases ,s/he will accordingly demand more and more return as com- pensation for the illiquidity , hence a posi- tively sloped yield curve. The Y ield C urve need not always be pos- itively sloped ,however . For instance, i n times of tight Federal Reserve monetary activities, short-term rates will be driven up. As markets have learned to interpret tight money policy as ef fective inflation- reducing medicine, which takes ef fect over future periods, the longer end of the yield curve tends to decline, leading to a negatively sloped, or “inverted,” yield curve . As Fed tightening usually does not last long (the 2004-2007 period being an obvious exception to this), inversions are similarly short-lived. The Y ield Curve normally is positively sloped due to Liq- uidity Pr eference –although it do es not have to be a straight line.

            "13.8 The T erm Structure of Interest Rates: F our Yield Curv e Theories Here we shall present four theories that attempt to explain why the Y ield Curve may take on one or another slope – upward (positive), flat, or downward (negative). W e can- not say that any one theory is more correct than the other , nor can we necessarily reconcile one theory in terms of another . Still, the following theories are eminently infor- mative. 1. Pur e Expectations – The Market Y ield reflects the aver- age of future short-term rates. First, we assume that investors think about the future and, specifically about the future direction of short-term interest rates. In this notion, we say that the observed Y ield Curve is, in a sense, secondary to what market players believe – in their minds – future short-term yields will be. If, as in the mathematical example below , market participants believe that future short-term yields will go higher and higher , then the observed yield curve will reflect this collective belief and be positive in slope – and vice versa. In other words, the Y ield Curve reflects market participants’ apri- oribeliefs. What makes this interesting is that while we can directly observe the Y ield Curve – after all, it is quoted in the media, and by traders and brokers – it is first the unex- pressed thoughts and beliefs about the direction of future short-term rates that determine the Y ield Curve’ s openly397 Kenneth S.Bigel 397\n",
            "\n",
            "expressed slope. W e know what is in the public’ s minds regarding the future by observing the ef fect of their collec- tive thought on the slope and shape of the “Y ield Curve.” The Y ield Curve expresses what people think about the future! Similarly , the observed Y ield Curve – mathematically – will express the average of market participants’ expecta- tions about the course of future short-term rates. For exam- ple, standing here today , in the here and now , and assuming first that the investor ’s horizon is two years, the investor is faced with two choices: (1) Buy a two-year bond, or (2) Buy a one-year bond and “roll it over” for another year when it comes due at the end of the first year . Given this line of thinking, if his horizon is three years, an investor can buy a three-year bond, or choose to consecu- tively roll it over twice. If we assume initially that the two choices in each case should be and are equivalent, we can extrapolate the investor ’s beliefs about the “Spot Curve,” i.e., the market’ s collective belief about future short-term rates, from the Y ield Curve, working backwards. Let’ s clar- ify by mathematical illustration. Here is an example of how we may calculate “Spot Rates,” or the “Spot Curve” given the Y ield Curve (“Market Y -T- M”). Introduction toFinancial Analysis 398\n",
            "\n",
            "Question: “x” and “y” represent the future short-term rates that market play- ers anticipate. Specifically , “x” represents the rate for the second period. Likewise, “y” represents the rate for the third period. Working backwards from the observed Y ield Curve, what are the values for the two unknowns? Again, we must assume that the two alternatives are equivalent. This mathematical process, by the way , is referred to as “Boot Strapping.” Solution: (1.08)2= (1 + .07) (1 + x) x= .09009 where, x = 2r1 (i.e., the one-year rate in the second year) The two alternatives – that of buying (or lending) a two- year instrument or buying (or lending) a one-year instru- ment and rolling it over at the end of the first year – must be viewed as equivalent alternatives if this idea were to work. And it does because should one alternative be superior , rational, smart market players would go for that399 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",
            "one, and the market’ s efficient self-correcting mechanism would drive the alternatives together . This is known as the Law of One Price . This “law” says that if two equal alternatives are present, they must offer the same price or , in this case, yield. If one of the choices were more attractive, investors would choose that one, dri- ving up the price and lowering the yield. They would sell the other , which would have, in the end, an equal and oppo- site ef fect. While we have used here the term “investors,” this ar gument refers to the activities of both borrowers and lenders, in fact. You should be able to draw these two curves (i.e., both the YTM Y ield Curve and Spot Curve, given the calculated values of “x” and “y”) on a chart, with the yield on the vertical and the years-to-maturity on the horizontal. Note that after the first year , the two curves diver ge, with the Spot Curve, in this example, rising above the Y ield Curve, pulling it upward. Investors expect future, short-term rates to increase! Of course, if the Y ield Curve is inverted (neg- atively sloped), the spot curve would be lower that it and we would conclude that future, short-term rate expectations are decreasing. As for the nomenclature noted above, and more formally speaking, “ 2r1” means the “spot rate” starting at the begin- ning of the second period for the length of one period, while “ 3r1“starts at the beginning of the third period for one period’ s length. Again, and in summary , why does this math work? This is based on two notions: first, that market players are “ratio- nal,” and make optimal decisions that maximize their wealth; second, that markets react “ef ficiently” to a per-Introduction toFinancial Analysis 400\n",

            "ceived mispricing should the two opportunities not be equivalent. T ogether , these two concepts (i.e., Rational Expectations and Ef ficient Markets) act in unison and cause the alternatives to be equivalent at present. What will actually happen tomorrow is another story . Under this Pure Expectations Theory , we say that the Y ield Curve has no apriori upward (positive) or downward (neg- ative; inverted) bias. The slope of the Y ield Curve simply reflects whether people think rates will be going up or down and will acquire its slope accordingly . The observed Yield Curve’ s slope thus is a consequence of Pure Expec- tations. 2. Liquidity Pr eference – Investors prefer Liquidity to illiquidity . Investors prefer to be liquid at all times in order to have the freedom to choose whether to spend or invest their funds. Don’ t we all want to be free? Should investors choose to tie up their money in an investment, they would demand to be compensated for the illiquidity that comes with investment. Should they tie up their money longer and longer , they would demand that they be increasingly compensated, in terms of higher yield, for their increasing illiquidity . Under this theory , therefore, we conclude that the Y ield Curve would have a notable upward bias. The theories of Pure Expectations and Liquidity Preference are said to work hand-in-hand. When we get both theories working in the same direction, that is, when the Spot Curve is positive, we get a positively sloped Y ield Curve. How- ever, if Pure Expectations are such that market participants believe that future short-term rates will decline, the slope will be determined by which force is greater than the other401 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",
            "– whether Pure Expectation outweighs Liquidity Prefer- ence or not.

There are two more theories to go. 3. Market Segmentation – different segments of the yield curve attract dif ferent issuers and investors and are thus subject to varying supply/demand conditions respectively . These conditions will determine the independent slopes of each segment. In Market Segmentation Theory , we say that participants generally invest or borrow in limited portions or “seg- ments” of the market. Commercial Banks invest very little in the long-term whereas Pension Funds are heavily invested there. Dif ferent players tend to “reside” in dif fer- ent “segments.” Given this segmentation, rates within it would be a func- tion of the supply and demand characteristics of each indi- vidual segment, separately and alone. Any changes in a particular maturity’ s yield would not af fect any other seg- ment, or rate, for any other maturity . There would, thus, be no ex-ante bias whatsoever for the slope of the Y ield Curve. In fact, the Y ield Curve could conceivably have multiple kinks. 4.

During weak economic periods, credit spreads widen, in response to fear – but not necessarily the reality – of the perceived risks associated with lower -rated bonds. In fact, default rates themselves may not worsen, but still, people get ner- vous. In such times, people demand more premium return versus T reasuries than before. How exactly does this happen? Many will sell their lower - rated bonds and buy safer T reasuries with the sale pro- ceeds. Lower -rated bonds’ prices therefore fall and their yields rise; T reasury prices will thus rise, and yields will go down. Credit spreads widen. Remember that price and yield (i.e., discount rates) are inversely related. This does not say that actual credits, i.e., default risks, have wors- ened; that may or may not eventually happen. A bond may be considered a “credit.” This phenomenon – whereby credit spreads widen – is referred to as a flight to quality . Below we illustrate the flight to quality .

When rates increased between 1978 and 1982, the spread between (T en-Y ear) T reasuries and Baa Corporate Bonds widened. Baa and BBB bond- holders lost money in part due to increased rates and, in addition, due to a widening of the spread (such bondholders would have lost less in T rea- suries). Credit spreads were wide when the technology “bubble” burst in 2000-2001. Greater credit spreads reduce corporations’ ability to borrow and thus serve to dampen economic growth.

High yield securities merely have lower credit ratings and therefore higher yields. In 1978, there was less than $10 billion worth of junk bonds outstanding – in terms of aggregate face value. In 2006, this figure exceeded $1 trillion! Whereas in the past, most issues consisted of “fallen angels,” or securities issued by corporations that once enjoyed investment grade credit ratings, but fell on hard times, today most junk bonds are originally issued as high yield securities. Further , emer ging markets the world over add to new issuance; the prospective high returns attract many investors. This low-grade security growth has precipitated two other interesting phenomena: the markets for “syndicated loans” and “leveraged loans.” Syndicated loans are package deals provided often by investment banks rather than commer- cial banks, which traditionally have made such lar ge loans. These loans are aggregated and packaged, and then “secu- ritized,” that is, sold as securities. Many of these bonds went bad in the 2007-2008 Banking Crisis.

Distr essed debt consists of junk bonds whose companies are in such dire straits that their yields are substantially higher than the risk-free rate. “Defaulted debt” represents corporations who have defaulted on their bond issues. A “default” may consist merely of the violation of its bank lending agreement or its bond’ sindentur e, i.e., the legal document, which sets forth all the terms of the loan, and which may require that the issuer maintain its financial ratios within certain parameters. It may also result, more seriously , from a late or missed interest payment. Vultur e funds are often operated by hedge funds and attempt to profit of f the remains of bankrupt corporations by pur- chasing the defaulted bonds and repos- sessing the company’ s assets. The vultures then sell of fthe assets at a profit. Typically , default rates increase as the economy enters a recession. Default rates are sometimes defined as the dollar amount of defaults relative to the aggre- gate amounts outstanding. The credit rat- ing agencies define default rates in connection with the number of high-yield issuers who default.409 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

In this chap- ter, we outlined four financial markets: money , capital, derivatives, and foreign exchange markets. The focus was, of course, on securities markets, that is, the markets for stocks and bonds. Securities markets, in turn, are connected to the macroeconomic world, and monetary and fiscal poli- cies are a key component of security markets analysis. The means by which corporations gain access to the finan- cial markets and its capital raising function is the subject of investment banking. In particular , we are interested in new securities’ issuance, or initial public of ferings (IPOs), but I-banking serves various other essential roles in our finan- cial sector . Interest rates af fect securities’ valuations, most visibly affecting bonds’ prices, but the impact on equities is notable also. This is but one example of the connections between macroeconomics and securities markets. In this section, we also glanced at the interconnections between interest rates of various sorts.

In this section, we will commence with a simple example of stock valuation, one which perfectly corresponds with this statement. W e shall then observe that the formulation does not conform to, or is not applicable to, many , or most, equity situations. For example, our starting point will be the application of this TVM premise to Preferred Stocks that have fixed dividends. However , what about other stocks, whose dividends are not constant? For this there will be another model, a variation on the original model. What about investors who buy stocks for capital growth rather than income? In other words, what about investors who do not care about dividends, but instead purchase stocks for profit? Most American stocks pay no dividends at all! What are such stocks worth? For that too, we shall offer a further refinement of the original model.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 414 414\n",

Here we imagine what the firm’ s assets would fetch were the firm to go out of business and its assets liquidated, i.e., sold of f to the highest bidders or available buy- ers. •Book V alue (BV) represents the accountant’ s stated net (common) equity divided by the num- ber of shares outstanding (NOSO). •Relative V alue compares a security to another based on some shared or relative metric, such as default risk.Introduction toFinancial Analysis 416 416\n",

Y ou may think of this as what the shares are “really” worth. Such formulae often rely on a discounted cash flow paradigm, e.g., the DDM. The intrin- sic value may dif fer from the market price, thereby of fering investors the opportunity to purchase shares cheaply or sell the shares short, if over -valued. Does V = P?

Intrin- sic value refers to what the security is “truly ”worth. T o the extent that P ≠ V , one would be presented with the opportunity to earn an extraordinary profit (by either buy- ing cheaply or selling “richly”) .Hereforward , we shall use P rather than V , although y ou may see V used elsewhere. A stock is a kind of perpetuity ; the corporation, as a going concern, is eternal. Dividends will be paid in perpetuity . Unlike bonds, there is no face value to be paid at a spec- ified time in the future. The only cash flows are the divi- dends. This formula says that the price of a stock is equal to its aggregated discounted future cash flows, i.e., the dividends discounted to present value. Since, for the moment we assume that dividends are fixed (as in a preferr edstock), the foregoing, never -ending equation may be simplified algebraically to the following (as was demonstrated for a perpetuity , only the terms have been modified to accommo- date stock):419 Kenneth S.Bigel 419\n",

This formulation presents a percentages view on the model; all terms are percentages. Note also that when G = 0, we have the “no-growth” ver- sion of the DDM. If G > 0, we have the “Constant-Growth” DDM. As discussed in the TVM section, R must exceed G for both practical / financial and mathematical reasons.

In general, if rates go up for a base rate, such as Treasuries, other rates will follow . Default risk : If a company’ s bond default risk increases, the dividend on preferred stock will also be less secure. Dis- count rates on “Preferreds” will go up and prices will go down. So too will the discount rate and price of common equity follow . The company’ s ability to pay common stock dividends and to retain additional earnings will be reduced. Remember: Default risk, essentially , has to do with the chance that a corporate borrower , or issuer of bonds, will not pay the interest on its borrowings in full and on time.

These three variables, when aggregated, will constitute the stock’ s risk (β). “R” can be stated (again) formulaically: RM= RF+ MRP MRP = Market Risk Pr emium = R M– RF RM= RF+ (RM– RF) βM The Market Return (R M) equals the Risk-free Rate (R F) plus a Market Risk Premium. 443 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",

            "14.14 Business Ethics: The Small Investor's Experience of Insider T rading We have just completed a discussion of the elements in securities’ valuation. Some individuals try to get an upper hand in their stock selections by engaging in illegal activi- ties. The following is a salient example. “Insider T rading” has to do with the personal use of mate- rial nonpublic information about the future prospects of a company – whether good or bad, in order to garner an unearned profit by trading its securities ahead of any public announcements regarding the pertinent information. An “insider” is an employee, a relative, or friend of an employee. Insider trading, in the United States, is illegal. Don’ t even think of it. Is such trading, from a moral point of view , fair or not? Is it fair that an insider may have an exploitable advantage to enrich himself/herself? Is the law “correct” in making it illegal? Imagine the scenario below and respond to the questions that follow: Suppose we focus on three parties to a series of transac- tions on a security at a point in time. Mr . X is interested in selling 1,000 shares of ABC corporation; Mr . Y is inter- ested in purchasing 1,000 shares; Mr . Z, an informed cor- porate insider , is interested in purchasing a lar ge block of the stock. Messrs. X and Y are small investors each of whom has personal reasons for engaging in the transaction.445 Kenneth S.Bigel 445\n",
            "\n",
            "In a normal market, X would sell to Y at the current price. Both parties would be satisfied at having engaged in the transaction. However , Mr. Z holds some critical informa- tion concerning the very favorable portents of the shares and wants to buy before the word gets out. His bid causes the share price to rise and thus Mr . X gets a higher price than he may have otherwise received, all else equal. No harm done. Due to the rise in share price, Mr . Y pays more than he may have otherwise. Such possible harm may be overcome by the pending rise of the shares once the information is announced. The slight short-term harm is overcome by the longer -term profits Mr . Y shall earn. Mr . Y may nonethe- less feel harmed. However , had Mr . X known about the pending release of favorable information, he may have either waited before selling or changed his mind completely about his decision to sell. Mr . X may feel harmed. Questions: 1.Justify Mr . Z’s insider trading on a moral basis. 2.Denounce Mr . Z’s trading – morally speaking. 3.What is your own view of Mr . Z’s trading? Find a moral justification for your position – apart from what you stated already .Introduction toFinancial Analysis 446\n",

            "14.16 P ortfolio Return (W eighted Averages) Now that we know all about individual bond and stock returns, what about portfolios of securities? A portfolio is a collection of individual securities. If the market values of the portfolio’ s constituent securities were the same, the portfolio weights would be equal, and the simple arithmetic- and weighted-averages would be the same. In calculating the simple arithmetic return, one would take the observed returns and divide by the number of observations. Here, the weights are unequal, so we must employ a weighted average calculation as below . Example : Calculate the (historical or expected) weighted average r eturn for the following portfolio, which consists of three securities (A, B, and C) and has the market values and individual returns as noted.453 Kenneth S.Bigel 453\n",
            "\n",
            "Note : Portfolio risk is notsimply a weighted-average of the portfolio constituents’ respective risks – due to “covari- ance” among securities. Portfolio Return (Solution to Problem) Solution (table form) : Solution (by formula) : RP= 1/6 (.10) + 1/3 (.12) + 1/2 (.16) = 0.1367Introduction toFinancial Analysis 454\n",
            "\n",
            "Short-cut solution : RP= [(100) (.10) + (200) (.12) + (300) (.16)] ÷ 600 = 0.1367 In the short-cut solution, we do not take the weights first. Instead, we multiply the dollar values by each expected return and, at the end, divide by the entire portfolio value. The 0.1367 return means that the investment would increase by 13.67% inone year . If you had invested $1,000, after one year ’s time, you would have one thousand dollars plus $136.70 for a total of $1,136.7. Some of the return, presumably , would come from income (rent, inter- est, or dividends) and some from capital growth (price appreciation). The constituent security returns, as given here, were themselves represented without any further detail as to the breakdown of income and growth portions. If the weights had all been equal (i.e., .3333, in this case), we could have calculated a simple average by adding the sum of the returns and dividing by ( n=) 3. In other words, a simple average implies equal weights. If one of the constituent security’ s returns were negative, we would of course get a dif ferent result. Let us say that the return on Security “A” were -.10, rather than positive. In this case, the portfolio return would be: RP= 1/6 (-.10) + 1/3 (.12) + 1/2 (.16) = .1033455 Kenneth S.Bigel\n",
            "\n",

            "14.17 The Geometric A verage Return: Multi-y ear Returns Generally , we quote return in annual terms. In order to calculate the return for multiple years, we must arrive at a reasonable, average annual return figure. Suppose you observe the following three (historical or pro- jected) annual returns: .10 .25 .35 The simple, arithmetic average return would be: [.10 + .25 + .35] ÷ 3 = .2333 For the average to be valid in terms of the time value of money , its future value should equal the product of the three observations. However , (1.2333)3≠ (1.10) (1.25) (1.35) Again, the conceptually correct average must be consistent with the time value of money and its “(1 + R)n” format. By modifying the line above and asking what the correct aver- age rate, “R,” should be, we arrive at: (1 + R)3= (1.10) (1.25) (1.35) (1 + R) = [(1.10) (1.25) (1.35)]1/3 R = [(1.10) (1.25) (1.35)]1/3– 1457 Kenneth S.Bigel 457\n",
            "\n",
            "R = .2289 81 Thus, the average multi-period return is 0.2290. This cal- culation is referred to as the “geometric average” and is consistent with the manner in which we do the time value of money . The general notation for this formula requires the use of product summation notation – “Π”(as opposed to using the usual sigma summation notation, Σ). The nota- tion reads as follows: Geometric Average = [Π (1 + R i)1/n] – 1 Question : What would this average be if the 10% observa- tion were negative? Answer : 0.1495. How did you get this? Note : Should there be a negative return in the mix as above, the same method should be used as always. The follow- ing should make common sense. For example, should one experience a 50% loss and a 100% gain in consecutive years, the geometric average return would be: [(1 + {-0.50}) × (1 + 1)]½– 1 = 0.0. Had you instead calculated the simple average, you would have gotten: [(-0.50) + (1.0)] ÷ 2 = 25%. That cannot be correct!Introduction toFinancial Analysis 458\n",
